The Peenemünde Army Research Center was founded in 1937 as one of five military proving grounds under the German Army Weapons Office. Several German guided missiles and rockets of World War II were developed by the HVP, including the V-2 rocket. The works were attacked by the British in Operation Crossbow from August 1943, before falling to the Soviets in May 1945.
