- How we see the life and how should we see it?
- We define the life based on our understanding/knowledge. The way we see the life, is the way we live it.
    - Everybody sees the life differently. (because it is based on their beliefs and beliefs are based on understanding).
    - Somebody sees pleasure/fun in life, somebody sees fights, 

```plaintext
Understanding --> Beliefs --> Way of life
```

- How did you understand the life?

How is our understanding?
- Like if someone lives his/her life based on movies, where they will end up?
- Movies create wrong understanding, which makes your beliefs wrong, which makes your life wrong.
