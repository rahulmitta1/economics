## Orthodox system (Astika)

- Those who strongly believe that there are existence of Veda and whatever we do it is inherited from the Veda.
- They also believe in rebirth or re-incarnation, and in the karma theory.
- They accept Veda. 

Orthodox system has further six systems
1. Yoga, 
2. Samkhya, 
3. Nyaya, 
4. Vaisesika, 
5. Purva-Mimansa 
6. and Uttar-Mimanasa. 
    - Uttar-Mimansa is after the Mimansa, when Mimansa ends.
    - Some people develop, or some of the successors, they developed this utter-Mimansa is known as Vedantha where Sankara,Ramanuja, Vallabhacharya, all people will appears.

This orthodox system forms three groups/pairs. 
1. Yoga-Samkhyam, 
2. Nyaya-Vaisesika 
3. Mimansa-Vedanta. 

In each pair there is one practical system and one theoritical system.
- Yoga always tells about the practical aspects and the way the people will do the practice. But, in other case samkhya philosophy always deals with the theoretical aspect. It focuses on the theoretical approach. 
- Nyaya talks about the practical aspect whereas, the vaisesika is the system, talks about the theoretical aspect. It focuses basically what are the theory behind that. 
- Mimansa is a very practical aspect whereas, the Vedanta is a theoretical aspect. 
    - In Vedanta, shankara said that only one iswara, there will be no further iswara. On his account, on his words, what he says that one iswara, ditiya nasti. That means if at all you are accepting something it is only one.
        - Across the religion you go to Hindu religion, Christian religion, Zoroastrian religion, even Muslim religion, any religion you go only one God. Because he is the supreme being, in that way Vedanta also expressed.
    - But, in case of mimansa they say that, where is god? Why god? Who is god? So, it is a kind of practical aspect. There it is a practical aspect of defining god or acceptance of Veda whereas, in case of Vedanta it is a theoretical approach.
