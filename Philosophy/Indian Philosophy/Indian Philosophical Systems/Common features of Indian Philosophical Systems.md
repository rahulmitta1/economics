Now, coming to the next slide. I said that now you understood there are six systems in Indian
philosophy. Out of six, three systems comes under heterodox who does not accept Veda and
another systems in a three pairs, you can say which comes under orthodox system who accept
Veda.
Now, we find what are the common features. So, that you can have a at least a very blue
sketching in your mind or a background kind of understanding what are the system is going
to tell about. So, therefore, I am saying common features of Indian philosophical systems
here I would like to bring you notice even that.
What I say common features of Indian philosophical system I never said Indian philosophical
all the system, what I mean is that whenever describing some of the common points do not
think that that common point we find across orthodox and heterodox system.
What I am saying there may be cases that there are some commonality define between two
system, three system. There are also cases that some of the commonality define between four
systems but, do not consider whenever we are discussing the points one after another, do not
consider that whatever points you are discussing find in all the systems.
So, therefore, this is your understanding you should be clear and confirm from this point. So,
that you would not be confused in later period. Now, you see that spiritual orientation. What
is a spiritual orientation?

You might have gone to many of these Rushis, take some of this advice from him or her, or
anywhere. You go for a spiritual say temple or say church anywhere, you pray and all these,
this is spiritual. Because you think that this is the almighty where if I can create something,
can be, I can gain it. Isn’t it? If this is case then there are other systems.
It is both heterodox and orthodox somehow other, they accept that there is a spirit. Here what
I am saying spirit, do not understand, it is spirit as a God, spirit as a power; that means, they
said that all human being has a power; that means, God in the form of some or other form
exist in every human beings life.
Therefore we able to think, we able to act, we able to see, we able to do all the things rest and
all things which other animals cannot do. It is just because of God’s grace we able to do it,
that is called spiritual orientation. So, while doing that they are also explaining that, how soul
exist; see we are human being. What is a human being above all?
Human being is not just you know, the parts of body and mind. If this is so, somebody say
that here hand is a part, your leg is also a part. If you just detach from that or if by accident
you get some operation and somehow unfortunately it is should be deduct, still you will be a
human being. People will consider the human being.
Then what is a human being at all? It is a body or mind or something else. This question
comes repeatedly in all the systems. They say that human being also the major part, are the
very certain part which is not visible that is called soul.
Every human being has a soul. And what is that soul? Our self; that to be explained further.
To say that, it is because of the self we able to speak out, we able to hear. If self is not
properly functioning then we are just material like a table and chair. When a human being
died and nothing remains, in that time the soul disappears. The soul detached from that body
therefore, after the death the body become as material as like table and chair. You hit the body
still the body has no reaction. Therefore they says that, all the system try to argue in their own
way that there is a soul exist in human being. Even all the animals who live in this earth, who
do some kind of activity and action in this earth. So, this is the way we understand what is a
human soul and what is self. If you ask now I believe that there are some questions may
becomes to your mind saying that, where the self is locating? For example, if somebody ask
where is my right hand. I can show my right hand but, if somebody ask where is your soul
locating. Then I could not able to see it, then I could not able to show it even; see this is my

soul. But, I can able to explain it, what is a soul, I mean and where it is really find, what is the
use of its soul. So, in this way we have to understand.
That means all the Indian philosophy system trying to say that if there is something existence,
it not only find in case of physical form, apart from that physical form also they are many
certain things which also equally important and also find in all this creatures or animals or
human being inside that and also act very prominently like as other physical part of their
body. So, that is kind of spiritual orientation that all trying to explain in their own way.
Now, coming to the next point that is closer to life, when we will say closer to life all the
orthodox system they believe as I said, the practice of the Vedanta, they believe the practice
of let us say, Veda, Gita, Upanishad, all these scriptures they believe. And they also thinks
that whatever action we are doing certainly at present, suppose I am able to speak something,
I able to identify something, it is already there in Gita and Upanishad. That is a old scripture,
still some essence we are now getting it and further when we saying that, closing to the life;
that means, whatever we do in our day to day activities, what we suppose to do and if
something we have done wrong also you can identify yes, this is not the perfect way of doing.
Suppose you are not respecting to our elders; that means, it is somewhere we are finding fault
with our self that yes, this is not the ethical practice.
And that is why all this scriptures in Indian system is close to our life. Now people say that,
now it is a life of modern life, I am in 21st century, everything works in a just click way in
internet. Still whatever we are doing some over the other, it is a find in a hidden form in Gita,
Upanishad and all these older scriptures.
While saying that, when orthodox people are claiming that all these are find in Gita and
Upanishad and all these old scripture, they know that, fully avoid that this scriptures are not
based on the words.
But rather these scriptures are based on the intuition. If this is so, the further claim that yes,
we all suggest, we all human beings are the seeker of this intuition because, once we get the
intuition or the power of intuition we can able to know what is going to happen in future and
what we are doing now. As a result we will be consider as a human being. And as a result, if
you know that this is the suffering, these are the pain, these are the attachment to the only
fears. So, we try to retry from that attachment or say only pleasure, as a result we get
happiness in our life.

So, these are all somehow comes to closer to our life because, day to day life we are facing
many problems and as a result if you do that kind of practice; practice for a yoga, practice for
a concentration, all this helps us to not only see the life in a very closer prospective rather to
understand many things in a very better way.
Now, I am reading out for your benefit. The classics of the Indian philosophy the Gita, the
Upanishad are not dissociated from human life. We have learnt many things from these
classics. Since we learn from our past hence past cannot be ignored or overlooked while
performing the present action.
So, the all I have elaborated in a very little manner. When all things will be getting more
discuss and with pure examples in our day to day life when we will be discussing the Vedanta
philosophy in a very clear manner or in other orthodox systems, coming to the next slides.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:05)

Now, if you see the spiritual dissatisfaction. What is a spiritual dissatisfaction? Say, as I said,
I am again repeating if you can now picturise what I have done this in the philosophical
system, orthodox and heterodox. Heterodox will be left side and orthodox will be right side.
He is saying that spiritual dissatisfaction, the heterodox people very clearly say that we do not
accept Veda. Nothing, nothing is lies in Veda but, still we get in a spiritual life. How you will
get it?

But orthodox people ask, how you get it? If you do not accept Veda or do not accept God,
how you can get it? Here if you find Buddhism, Jainism and Charvaka they said that, we all
are believer of spirit. Spirit here for us is a power, is an achievement, the goal that we are
seeking for.
As Buddha says that, there is a noble truth, four noble truth. Buddha says that the whole
world is full of pain, full of suffering, full of measuring but, there are every reasons to have
all these effect like sufferings, pain and seeking for pleasures. If you can know the root
causes where the pain lies then somehow other you understand this is the causes and I have to
address to that causes so that this causes will be eradicated as a result the effect also
eradicated.
Some people have craving towards getting, let us say, promotion. Suppose as a student also
you must have a craving that without studying anything you will get pass mark even also you
can also achieve many things without doing anything. Isn’t it? But, there Buddha says that
without labour, without effort nothing will available at free of cost.
If you do also, in later period you face problems and that problem nobody can help because
you have not understood middle steps of that. So, therefore, I am saying that there are
sufferings, many pains in whole our life. What you have to do with that, you have to know
what is the root causes of all the sufferings. If that is the spirit, if you know this, then you can
eradicate all the sufferings in your whole life, enhance. You will have a happy life because
you are detached from all these worldly pressure life.
However, you will get pleasure once you will find yourself as a reunion. You find your mind
is concentration. You identify what is a soul, where is your soul, who you are. All these you
can define yourself. Therefore, this kind of pleasure you’ll get it which is never find in case
of worldly pleasure.
Worldly pleasure has, what I mean is that, when you are very preplanning for getting a, let us
say, good bikes, good motorcycles, in a luxury items all this, it is a more than basic
necessities, it is called worldly pleasure. Now, if you it is, read that one that although, Buddha
and Jana do not prescribe this spiritual activities as astika do, but certainly they aim at for the
optimistic approach and removal of pessimism.

In majority, in most of the cases we find them moving toward happiness of life. They said,
also they recommend we get happiness in our life provided we must know that where
happiness lies. Until unless, we know where happiness lies we cannot get the happiness.
Rather we ignorantly consider the un-happiness either happiness. This is the spirit of
heterodox system. Now, if you see the last point that is, liberation is the ultimate end. What it
says is that, I am reading for you that, knowledge in Indian philosophy means divine
transformation of life and emancipation from worldly miseries. The second, it is spiritual
stage where human beings found themselves over and above the earthly attachments. Now, I
am elaborating further for your own understanding. Liberation is the ultimate end. People say
that, Oh! At last I liberated. Suppose you are trying to do something and at last you could able
to do it, you say that, Oh my God ! At last I got liberation; that means, everything is ever for
you. Now, if this is you understood now I am bringing that context to the philosophical
domain, in Indian philosophy. What it is saying that, Indian philosophical system saying that,
the whole life of a human being, when a baby burns start suffering....suffering.....suffering.
Because of many causes; it is not because of human or because of may be some social
conditions, cultural atmosphere, even the religious atmosphere, many other conditions,
economic background and many other condition, n number of condition that you know and it
varies from person to person.
If this is so, then you say that, once you know also the root causes how to get liberation from
that, what is the path of liberation? What did liberation means that? You identify the real
causes and try not to do further. So, that you get liberated.
To do the liberation there are many systems prescribed, there are many ways and differently.
This is happens just because as I said Indian philosophical system never popup in a one year
itself, it took so much, several year of traditions to come up, right. And there are many people
contributed for a particular system and hence for depend on their background, depend on
their understanding, they differ in opinion from person to person, even from system to
system.
But, however, the common essence lies that they all are trying to get liberate. Liberate from
suffering, liberate from all this pains, liberate from all this seeking of this material pleasure
and the liberation from the whole world.

That yes, I have a happily life because I liberate from all these. I do not need all this material
attachment. I as a human being, I need a basic necessity for my survival and I am happy to
that. The common ethical point what they want to highlight here is that suppose you are
doing some job you should be happy with that. Suppose you are getting something you
should be happy of that. But, your work should be continued further. If you think that in a
certain you’ll achieve many things and then you will fall in the trap that will be doing some
kind of unethical practice which leads you to gets so much problem in your life in the future
time.
So, therefore, try to be happy what you are first. Once you will be happy, feel happy within
yourself. So that, this is one of the liberation, you get it. Once you can do that you will feel
really your existence and you are yourself as a very pleasurly and happy person in this world
so that all suffering you never find inner whole life.

Now, coming to the next slides. Yeah! This is an ignorance. I said that before this slides also.
I said that because of ignorance many people suffer. Even there are many people in this
world, they do not know they are ignorant. The reason behind that, the reason is very clear
because they may not face many of the situations which they supposed to face. And also they
are ignorant because they may not see the world in a very complete form and hence for their
ignorance it is very crude way. If they will do some mistakes also they do not know what they
have to do.

Further, but still there is to hide that they do further mistakes. As a result what happens in
future they will be go on doing many mistakes because of their ignorance. And it is just
because of the ignorance they could not identify even what they have done wrong. If they
could haven’t identify in future they could not repeat the same thing but, as a result if
somebody can do that, somebody can properly identify what the unethical practices he or she
is doing, what is my ignorance? Where I have to learn further? Where I have to understand
further? If somebody can do that in future, these are the things, these are the miseries, these
are the sufferings never appears.
So, ignorance is the root cause of all suffering. If they are knowledgeable enough, if you can
understand what really lies for your suffering, for the causes of suffering that hopefully you
can eradicate that. That is a ignorance.
There are many people also ignorantly say that, we do not accept anything. All that they do
not know about that thing. It will be always better to know something, to understand
something, then you say that with your logical argument and also reasonable argument, say
that we are not accepting because of so and so reason.
In that case it is completely acceptable but, if you say that anything will be fine before you
ensure that I am not accepting. In this case it is just a fail from your side; that means, your
ignorant and you could not able to identify that you are doing some ignorant thing.
Hence for I suggest and also all the Indian philosophical systems subscribe that first of all as
a human being we should know that where we are ignorant, where we need to develop, where
we need to have more understanding. If you can do that then the life will be very peaceful
and you will get a very spiritual life.
Now, coming to the next slide. I said that now you understood there are six systems in Indian
philosophy. Out of six, three systems comes under heterodox who does not accept Veda and
another systems in a three pairs, you can say which comes under orthodox system who accept

Now, we find what are the common features. So, that you can have a at least a very blue
sketching in your mind or a background kind of understanding what are the system is going
to tell about. So, therefore, I am saying common features of Indian philosophical systems
here I would like to bring you notice even that.
What I say common features of Indian philosophical system I never said Indian philosophical
all the system, what I mean is that whenever describing some of the common points do not
think that that common point we find across orthodox and heterodox system.
What I am saying there may be cases that there are some commonality define between two
system, three system. There are also cases that some of the commonality define between four
systems but, do not consider whenever we are discussing the points one after another, do not
consider that whatever points you are discussing find in all the systems.
So, therefore, this is your understanding you should be clear and confirm from this point. So,
that you would not be confused in later period. Now, you see that spiritual orientation. What
is a spiritual orientation?

You might have gone to many of these Rushis, take some of this advice from him or her, or
anywhere. You go for a spiritual say temple or say church anywhere, you pray and all these,
this is spiritual. Because you think that this is the almighty where if I can create something,
can be, I can gain it. Isn’t it? If this is case then there are other systems.
It is both heterodox and orthodox somehow other, they accept that there is a spirit. Here what
I am saying spirit, do not understand, it is spirit as a God, spirit as a power; that means, they
said that all human being has a power; that means, God in the form of some or other form
exist in every human beings life.
Therefore we able to think, we able to act, we able to see, we able to do all the things rest and
all things which other animals cannot do. It is just because of God’s grace we able to do it,
that is called spiritual orientation. So, while doing that they are also explaining that, how soul
exist; see we are human being. What is a human being above all?
Human being is not just you know, the parts of body and mind. If this is so, somebody say
that here hand is a part, your leg is also a part. If you just detach from that or if by accident
you get some operation and somehow unfortunately it is should be deduct, still you will be a
human being. People will consider the human being.
Then what is a human being at all? It is a body or mind or something else. This question
comes repeatedly in all the systems. They say that human being also the major part, are the
very certain part which is not visible that is called soul.
Every human being has a soul. And what is that soul? Our self; that to be explained further.
To say that, it is because of the self we able to speak out, we able to hear. If self is not
properly functioning then we are just material like a table and chair. When a human being
died and nothing remains, in that time the soul disappears. The soul detached from that body
therefore, after the death the body become as material as like table and chair. You hit the body
still the body has no reaction. Therefore they says that, all the system try to argue in their own
way that there is a soul exist in human being. Even all the animals who live in this earth, who
do some kind of activity and action in this earth. So, this is the way we understand what is a
human soul and what is self. If you ask now I believe that there are some questions may
becomes to your mind saying that, where the self is locating? For example, if somebody ask
where is my right hand. I can show my right hand but, if somebody ask where is your soul
locating. Then I could not able to see it, then I could not able to show it even; see this is my

soul. But, I can able to explain it, what is a soul, I mean and where it is really find, what is the
use of its soul. So, in this way we have to understand.
That means all the Indian philosophy system trying to say that if there is something existence,
it not only find in case of physical form, apart from that physical form also they are many
certain things which also equally important and also find in all this creatures or animals or
human being inside that and also act very prominently like as other physical part of their
body. So, that is kind of spiritual orientation that all trying to explain in their own way.
Now, coming to the next point that is closer to life, when we will say closer to life all the
orthodox system they believe as I said, the practice of the Vedanta, they believe the practice
of let us say, Veda, Gita, Upanishad, all these scriptures they believe. And they also thinks
that whatever action we are doing certainly at present, suppose I am able to speak something,
I able to identify something, it is already there in Gita and Upanishad. That is a old scripture,
still some essence we are now getting it and further when we saying that, closing to the life;
that means, whatever we do in our day to day activities, what we suppose to do and if
something we have done wrong also you can identify yes, this is not the perfect way of doing.
Suppose you are not respecting to our elders; that means, it is somewhere we are finding fault
with our self that yes, this is not the ethical practice.
And that is why all this scriptures in Indian system is close to our life. Now people say that,
now it is a life of modern life, I am in 21st century, everything works in a just click way in
internet. Still whatever we are doing some over the other, it is a find in a hidden form in Gita,
Upanishad and all these older scriptures.
While saying that, when orthodox people are claiming that all these are find in Gita and
Upanishad and all these old scripture, they know that, fully avoid that this scriptures are not
based on the words.
But rather these scriptures are based on the intuition. If this is so, the further claim that yes,
we all suggest, we all human beings are the seeker of this intuition because, once we get the
intuition or the power of intuition we can able to know what is going to happen in future and
what we are doing now. As a result we will be consider as a human being. And as a result, if
you know that this is the suffering, these are the pain, these are the attachment to the only
fears. So, we try to retry from that attachment or say only pleasure, as a result we get
happiness in our life.

So, these are all somehow comes to closer to our life because, day to day life we are facing
many problems and as a result if you do that kind of practice; practice for a yoga, practice for
a concentration, all this helps us to not only see the life in a very closer prospective rather to
understand many things in a very better way.
Now, I am reading out for your benefit. The classics of the Indian philosophy the Gita, the
Upanishad are not dissociated from human life. We have learnt many things from these
classics. Since we learn from our past hence past cannot be ignored or overlooked while
performing the present action.
So, the all I have elaborated in a very little manner. When all things will be getting more
discuss and with pure examples in our day to day life when we will be discussing the Vedanta
philosophy in a very clear manner or in other orthodox systems, coming to the next slides.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:05)

Now, if you see the spiritual dissatisfaction. What is a spiritual dissatisfaction? Say, as I said,
I am again repeating if you can now picturise what I have done this in the philosophical
system, orthodox and heterodox. Heterodox will be left side and orthodox will be right side.
He is saying that spiritual dissatisfaction, the heterodox people very clearly say that we do not
accept Veda. Nothing, nothing is lies in Veda but, still we get in a spiritual life. How you will
get it?

But orthodox people ask, how you get it? If you do not accept Veda or do not accept God,
how you can get it? Here if you find Buddhism, Jainism and Charvaka they said that, we all
are believer of spirit. Spirit here for us is a power, is an achievement, the goal that we are
seeking for.
As Buddha says that, there is a noble truth, four noble truth. Buddha says that the whole
world is full of pain, full of suffering, full of measuring but, there are every reasons to have
all these effect like sufferings, pain and seeking for pleasures. If you can know the root
causes where the pain lies then somehow other you understand this is the causes and I have to
address to that causes so that this causes will be eradicated as a result the effect also
eradicated.
Some people have craving towards getting, let us say, promotion. Suppose as a student also
you must have a craving that without studying anything you will get pass mark even also you
can also achieve many things without doing anything. Isn’t it? But, there Buddha says that
without labour, without effort nothing will available at free of cost.
If you do also, in later period you face problems and that problem nobody can help because
you have not understood middle steps of that. So, therefore, I am saying that there are
sufferings, many pains in whole our life. What you have to do with that, you have to know
what is the root causes of all the sufferings. If that is the spirit, if you know this, then you can
eradicate all the sufferings in your whole life, enhance. You will have a happy life because
you are detached from all these worldly pressure life.
However, you will get pleasure once you will find yourself as a reunion. You find your mind
is concentration. You identify what is a soul, where is your soul, who you are. All these you
can define yourself. Therefore, this kind of pleasure you’ll get it which is never find in case
of worldly pleasure.
Worldly pleasure has, what I mean is that, when you are very preplanning for getting a, let us
say, good bikes, good motorcycles, in a luxury items all this, it is a more than basic
necessities, it is called worldly pleasure. Now, if you it is, read that one that although, Buddha
and Jana do not prescribe this spiritual activities as astika do, but certainly they aim at for the
optimistic approach and removal of pessimism.

In majority, in most of the cases we find them moving toward happiness of life. They said,
also they recommend we get happiness in our life provided we must know that where
happiness lies. Until unless, we know where happiness lies we cannot get the happiness.
Rather we ignorantly consider the un-happiness either happiness. This is the spirit of
heterodox system. Now, if you see the last point that is, liberation is the ultimate end. What it
says is that, I am reading for you that, knowledge in Indian philosophy means divine
transformation of life and emancipation from worldly miseries. The second, it is spiritual
stage where human beings found themselves over and above the earthly attachments. Now, I
am elaborating further for your own understanding. Liberation is the ultimate end. People say
that, Oh! At last I liberated. Suppose you are trying to do something and at last you could able
to do it, you say that, Oh my God ! At last I got liberation; that means, everything is ever for
you. Now, if this is you understood now I am bringing that context to the philosophical
domain, in Indian philosophy. What it is saying that, Indian philosophical system saying that,
the whole life of a human being, when a baby burns start suffering....suffering.....suffering.
Because of many causes; it is not because of human or because of may be some social
conditions, cultural atmosphere, even the religious atmosphere, many other conditions,
economic background and many other condition, n number of condition that you know and it
varies from person to person.
If this is so, then you say that, once you know also the root causes how to get liberation from
that, what is the path of liberation? What did liberation means that? You identify the real
causes and try not to do further. So, that you get liberated.
To do the liberation there are many systems prescribed, there are many ways and differently.
This is happens just because as I said Indian philosophical system never popup in a one year
itself, it took so much, several year of traditions to come up, right. And there are many people
contributed for a particular system and hence for depend on their background, depend on
their understanding, they differ in opinion from person to person, even from system to
system.
But, however, the common essence lies that they all are trying to get liberate. Liberate from
suffering, liberate from all this pains, liberate from all this seeking of this material pleasure
and the liberation from the whole world.

That yes, I have a happily life because I liberate from all these. I do not need all this material
attachment. I as a human being, I need a basic necessity for my survival and I am happy to
that. The common ethical point what they want to highlight here is that suppose you are
doing some job you should be happy with that. Suppose you are getting something you
should be happy of that. But, your work should be continued further. If you think that in a
certain you’ll achieve many things and then you will fall in the trap that will be doing some
kind of unethical practice which leads you to gets so much problem in your life in the future
time.
So, therefore, try to be happy what you are first. Once you will be happy, feel happy within
yourself. So that, this is one of the liberation, you get it. Once you can do that you will feel
really your existence and you are yourself as a very pleasurly and happy person in this world
so that all suffering you never find inner whole life.
(Refer Slide Time: 23:40)

Now, coming to the next slides. Yeah! This is an ignorance. I said that before this slides also.
I said that because of ignorance many people suffer. Even there are many people in this
world, they do not know they are ignorant. The reason behind that, the reason is very clear
because they may not face many of the situations which they supposed to face. And also they
are ignorant because they may not see the world in a very complete form and hence for their
ignorance it is very crude way. If they will do some mistakes also they do not know what they
have to do.

Further, but still there is to hide that they do further mistakes. As a result what happens in
future they will be go on doing many mistakes because of their ignorance. And it is just
because of the ignorance they could not identify even what they have done wrong. If they
could haven’t identify in future they could not repeat the same thing but, as a result if
somebody can do that, somebody can properly identify what the unethical practices he or she
is doing, what is my ignorance? Where I have to learn further? Where I have to understand
further? If somebody can do that in future, these are the things, these are the miseries, these
are the sufferings never appears.
So, ignorance is the root cause of all suffering. If they are knowledgeable enough, if you can
understand what really lies for your suffering, for the causes of suffering that hopefully you
can eradicate that. That is a ignorance.
There are many people also ignorantly say that, we do not accept anything. All that they do
not know about that thing. It will be always better to know something, to understand
something, then you say that with your logical argument and also reasonable argument, say
that we are not accepting because of so and so reason.
In that case it is completely acceptable but, if you say that anything will be fine before you
ensure that I am not accepting. In this case it is just a fail from your side; that means, your
ignorant and you could not able to identify that you are doing some ignorant thing.
Hence for I suggest and also all the Indian philosophical systems subscribe that first of all as
a human being we should know that where we are ignorant, where we need to develop, where
we need to have more understanding. If you can do that then the life will be very peaceful
and you will get a very spiritual life.
Now, coming to the next slide. I said that now you understood there are six systems in Indian
philosophy. Out of six, three systems comes under heterodox who does not accept Veda and
another systems in a three pairs, you can say which comes under orthodox system who accept
Veda.
Now, we find what are the common features. So, that you can have a at least a very blue
sketching in your mind or a background kind of understanding what are the system is going
to tell about. So, therefore, I am saying common features of Indian philosophical systems
here I would like to bring you notice even that.
What I say common features of Indian philosophical system I never said Indian philosophical

So, therefore, this is your understanding you should be clear and confirm from this point. So,
that you would not be confused in later period. Now, you see that spiritual orientation. What
is a spiritual orientation?

You might have gone to many of these Rushis, take some of this advice from him or her, or

to tell about. So, therefore, I am saying common features of Indian philosophical systems
here I would like to bring you notice even that.
What I say common features of Indian philosophical system I never said Indian philosophical
all the system, what I mean is that whenever describing some of the common points do not
think that that common point we find across orthodox and heterodox system.
What I am saying there may be cases that there are some commonality define between two
system, three system. There are also cases that some of the commonality define between four
systems but, do not consider whenever we are discussing the points one after another, do not
consider that whatever points you are discussing find in all the systems.
So, therefore, this is your understanding you should be clear and confirm from this point. So,
that you would not be confused in later period. Now, you see that spiritual orientation. What
is a spiritual orientation?

You might have gone to many of these Rushis, take some of this advice from him or her, or
anywhere. You go for a spiritual say temple or say church anywhere, you pray and all these,
this is spiritual. Because you think that this is the almighty where if I can create something,
can be, I can gain it. Isn’t it? If this is case then there are other systems.
It is both heterodox and orthodox somehow other, they accept that there is a spirit. Here what
I am saying spirit, do not understand, it is spirit as a God, spirit as a power; that means, they
said that all human being has a power; that means, God in the form of some or other form
exist in every human beings life.
Therefore we able to think, we able to act, we able to see, we able to do all the things rest and
all things which other animals cannot do. It is just because of God’s grace we able to do it,
that is called spiritual orientation. So, while doing that they are also explaining that, how soul
exist; see we are human being. What is a human being above all?
Human being is not just you know, the parts of body and mind. If this is so, somebody say
that here hand is a part, your leg is also a part. If you just detach from that or if by accident
you get some operation and somehow unfortunately it is should be deduct, still you will be a
human being. People will consider the human being.
Then what is a human being at all? It is a body or mind or something else. This question
comes repeatedly in all the systems. They say that human being also the major part, are the
very certain part which is not visible that is called soul.
Every human being has a soul. And what is that soul? Our self; that to be explained further.
To say that, it is because of the self we able to speak out, we able to hear. If self is not
properly functioning then we are just material like a table and chair. When a human being
died and nothing remains, in that time the soul disappears. The soul detached from that body
therefore, after the death the body become as material as like table and chair. You hit the body
still the body has no reaction. Therefore they says that, all the system try to argue in their own
way that there is a soul exist in human being. Even all the animals who live in this earth, who
do some kind of activity and action in this earth. So, this is the way we understand what is a
human soul and what is self. If you ask now I believe that there are some questions may
becomes to your mind saying that, where the self is locating? For example, if somebody ask
where is my right hand. I can show my right hand but, if somebody ask where is your soul
locating. Then I could not able to see it, then I could not able to show it even; see this is my

soul. But, I can able to explain it, what is a soul, I mean and where it is really find, what is the
use of its soul. So, in this way we have to understand.
That means all the Indian philosophy system trying to say that if there is something existence,
it not only find in case of physical form, apart from that physical form also they are many
certain things which also equally important and also find in all this creatures or animals or
human being inside that and also act very prominently like as other physical part of their
body. So, that is kind of spiritual orientation that all trying to explain in their own way.
Now, coming to the next point that is closer to life, when we will say closer to life all the
orthodox system they believe as I said, the practice of the Vedanta, they believe the practice
of let us say, Veda, Gita, Upanishad, all these scriptures they believe. And they also thinks
that whatever action we are doing certainly at present, suppose I am able to speak something,
I able to identify something, it is already there in Gita and Upanishad. That is a old scripture,
still some essence we are now getting it and further when we saying that, closing to the life;
that means, whatever we do in our day to day activities, what we suppose to do and if
something we have done wrong also you can identify yes, this is not the perfect way of doing.
Suppose you are not respecting to our elders; that means, it is somewhere we are finding fault
with our self that yes, this is not the ethical practice.
And that is why all this scriptures in Indian system is close to our life. Now people say that,
now it is a life of modern life, I am in 21st century, everything works in a just click way in
internet. Still whatever we are doing some over the other, it is a find in a hidden form in Gita,
Upanishad and all these older scriptures.
While saying that, when orthodox people are claiming that all these are find in Gita and
Upanishad and all these old scripture, they know that, fully avoid that this scriptures are not
based on the words.
But rather these scriptures are based on the intuition. If this is so, the further claim that yes,
we all suggest, we all human beings are the seeker of this intuition because, once we get the
intuition or the power of intuition we can able to know what is going to happen in future and
what we are doing now. As a result we will be consider as a human being. And as a result, if
you know that this is the suffering, these are the pain, these are the attachment to the only
fears. So, we try to retry from that attachment or say only pleasure, as a result we get
happiness in our life.

So, these are all somehow comes to closer to our life because, day to day life we are facing
many problems and as a result if you do that kind of practice; practice for a yoga, practice for
a concentration, all this helps us to not only see the life in a very closer prospective rather to
understand many things in a very better way.
Now, I am reading out for your benefit. The classics of the Indian philosophy the Gita, the
Upanishad are not dissociated from human life. We have learnt many things from these
classics. Since we learn from our past hence past cannot be ignored or overlooked while
performing the present action.
So, the all I have elaborated in a very little manner. When all things will be getting more
discuss and with pure examples in our day to day life when we will be discussing the Vedanta
philosophy in a very clear manner or in other orthodox systems, coming to the next slides.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:05)

Now, if you see the spiritual dissatisfaction. What is a spiritual dissatisfaction? Say, as I said,
I am again repeating if you can now picturise what I have done this in the philosophical
system, orthodox and heterodox. Heterodox will be left side and orthodox will be right side.
He is saying that spiritual dissatisfaction, the heterodox people very clearly say that we do not
accept Veda. Nothing, nothing is lies in Veda but, still we get in a spiritual life. How you will
get it?

But orthodox people ask, how you get it? If you do not accept Veda or do not accept God,
how you can get it? Here if you find Buddhism, Jainism and Charvaka they said that, we all
are believer of spirit. Spirit here for us is a power, is an achievement, the goal that we are
seeking for.
As Buddha says that, there is a noble truth, four noble truth. Buddha says that the whole
world is full of pain, full of suffering, full of measuring but, there are every reasons to have
all these effect like sufferings, pain and seeking for pleasures. If you can know the root
causes where the pain lies then somehow other you understand this is the causes and I have to
address to that causes so that this causes will be eradicated as a result the effect also
eradicated.
Some people have craving towards getting, let us say, promotion. Suppose as a student also
you must have a craving that without studying anything you will get pass mark even also you
can also achieve many things without doing anything. Isn’t it? But, there Buddha says that
without labour, without effort nothing will available at free of cost.
If you do also, in later period you face problems and that problem nobody can help because
you have not understood middle steps of that. So, therefore, I am saying that there are
sufferings, many pains in whole our life. What you have to do with that, you have to know
what is the root causes of all the sufferings. If that is the spirit, if you know this, then you can
eradicate all the sufferings in your whole life, enhance. You will have a happy life because
you are detached from all these worldly pressure life.
However, you will get pleasure once you will find yourself as a reunion. You find your mind
is concentration. You identify what is a soul, where is your soul, who you are. All these you
can define yourself. Therefore, this kind of pleasure you’ll get it which is never find in case
of worldly pleasure.
Worldly pleasure has, what I mean is that, when you are very preplanning for getting a, let us
say, good bikes, good motorcycles, in a luxury items all this, it is a more than basic
necessities, it is called worldly pleasure. Now, if you it is, read that one that although, Buddha
and Jana do not prescribe this spiritual activities as astika do, but certainly they aim at for the
optimistic approach and removal of pessimism.

In majority, in most of the cases we find them moving toward happiness of life. They said,
also they recommend we get happiness in our life provided we must know that where
happiness lies. Until unless, we know where happiness lies we cannot get the happiness.
Rather we ignorantly consider the un-happiness either happiness. This is the spirit of
heterodox system. Now, if you see the last point that is, liberation is the ultimate end. What it
says is that, I am reading for you that, knowledge in Indian philosophy means divine
transformation of life and emancipation from worldly miseries. The second, it is spiritual
stage where human beings found themselves over and above the earthly attachments. Now, I
am elaborating further for your own understanding. Liberation is the ultimate end. People say
that, Oh! At last I liberated. Suppose you are trying to do something and at last you could able
to do it, you say that, Oh my God ! At last I got liberation; that means, everything is ever for
you. Now, if this is you understood now I am bringing that context to the philosophical
domain, in Indian philosophy. What it is saying that, Indian philosophical system saying that,
the whole life of a human being, when a baby burns start suffering....suffering.....suffering.
Because of many causes; it is not because of human or because of may be some social
conditions, cultural atmosphere, even the religious atmosphere, many other conditions,
economic background and many other condition, n number of condition that you know and it
varies from person to person.
If this is so, then you say that, once you know also the root causes how to get liberation from
that, what is the path of liberation? What did liberation means that? You identify the real
causes and try not to do further. So, that you get liberated.
To do the liberation there are many systems prescribed, there are many ways and differently.
This is happens just because as I said Indian philosophical system never popup in a one year
itself, it took so much, several year of traditions to come up, right. And there are many people
contributed for a particular system and hence for depend on their background, depend on
their understanding, they differ in opinion from person to person, even from system to
system.
But, however, the common essence lies that they all are trying to get liberate. Liberate from
suffering, liberate from all this pains, liberate from all this seeking of this material pleasure
and the liberation from the whole world.

That yes, I have a happily life because I liberate from all these. I do not need all this material
attachment. I as a human being, I need a basic necessity for my survival and I am happy to
that. The common ethical point what they want to highlight here is that suppose you are
doing some job you should be happy with that. Suppose you are getting something you
should be happy of that. But, your work should be continued further. If you think that in a
certain you’ll achieve many things and then you will fall in the trap that will be doing some
kind of unethical practice which leads you to gets so much problem in your life in the future
time.
So, therefore, try to be happy what you are first. Once you will be happy, feel happy within
yourself. So that, this is one of the liberation, you get it. Once you can do that you will feel
really your existence and you are yourself as a very pleasurly and happy person in this world
so that all suffering you never find inner whole life.
(Refer Slide Time: 23:40)

Now, coming to the next slides. Yeah! This is an ignorance. I said that before this slides also.
I said that because of ignorance many people suffer. Even there are many people in this
world, they do not know they are ignorant. The reason behind that, the reason is very clear
because they may not face many of the situations which they supposed to face. And also they
are ignorant because they may not see the world in a very complete form and hence for their
ignorance it is very crude way. If they will do some mistakes also they do not know what they
have to do.

Further, but still there is to hide that they do further mistakes. As a result what happens in
future they will be go on doing many mistakes because of their ignorance. And it is just
because of the ignorance they could not identify even what they have done wrong. If they
could haven’t identify in future they could not repeat the same thing but, as a result if
somebody can do that, somebody can properly identify what the unethical practices he or she
is doing, what is my ignorance? Where I have to learn further? Where I have to understand
further? If somebody can do that in future, these are the things, these are the miseries, these
are the sufferings never appears.
So, ignorance is the root cause of all suffering. If they are knowledgeable enough, if you can
understand what really lies for your suffering, for the causes of suffering that hopefully you
can eradicate that. That is a ignorance.
There are many people also ignorantly say that, we do not accept anything. All that they do
not know about that thing. It will be always better to know something, to understand
something, then you say that with your logical argument and also reasonable argument, say
that we are not accepting because of so and so reason.
In that case it is completely acceptable but, if you say that anything will be fine before you
ensure that I am not accepting. In this case it is just a fail from your side; that means, your
ignorant and you could not able to identify that you are doing some ignorant thing.
Hence for I suggest and also all the Indian philosophical systems subscribe that first of all as
a human being we should know that where we are ignorant, where we need to develop, where
we need to have more understanding. If you can do that then the life will be very peaceful
and you will get a very spiritual life.
Now, coming to the next slide. I said that now you understood there are six systems in Indian
philosophy. Out of six, three systems comes under heterodox who does not accept Veda and
another systems in a three pairs, you can say which comes under orthodox system who accept
Veda.
Now, we find what are the common features. So, that you can have a at least a very blue
sketching in your mind or a background kind of understanding what are the system is going
to tell about. So, therefore, I am saying common features of Indian philosophical systems
here I would like to bring you notice even that.
What I say common features of Indian philosophical system I never said Indian philosophical

So, therefore, this is your understanding you should be clear and confirm from this point. So,
that you would not be confused in later period. Now, you see that spiritual orientation. What
is a spiritual orientation?

here I would like to bring you notice even that.
What I say common features of Indian philosophical system I never said Indian philosophical
all the system, what I mean is that whenever describing some of the common points do not
think that that common point we find across orthodox and heterodox system.
What I am saying there may be cases that there are some commonality define between two
system, three system. There are also cases that some of the commonality define between four
systems but, do not consider whenever we are discussing the points one after another, do not
consider that whatever points you are discussing find in all the systems.
So, therefore, this is your understanding you should be clear and confirm from this point. So,
that you would not be confused in later period. Now, you see that spiritual orientation. What
is a spiritual orientation?

You might have gone to many of these Rushis, take some of this advice from him or her, or
anywhere. You go for a spiritual say temple or say church anywhere, you pray and all these,
this is spiritual. Because you think that this is the almighty where if I can create something,
can be, I can gain it. Isn’t it? If this is case then there are other systems.
It is both heterodox and orthodox somehow other, they accept that there is a spirit. Here what
I am saying spirit, do not understand, it is spirit as a God, spirit as a power; that means, they
said that all human being has a power; that means, God in the form of some or other form
exist in every human beings life.
Therefore we able to think, we able to act, we able to see, we able to do all the things rest and
all things which other animals cannot do. It is just because of God’s grace we able to do it,
that is called spiritual orientation. So, while doing that they are also explaining that, how soul
exist; see we are human being. What is a human being above all?
Human being is not just you know, the parts of body and mind. If this is so, somebody say
that here hand is a part, your leg is also a part. If you just detach from that or if by accident
you get some operation and somehow unfortunately it is should be deduct, still you will be a
human being. People will consider the human being.
Then what is a human being at all? It is a body or mind or something else. This question
comes repeatedly in all the systems. They say that human being also the major part, are the
very certain part which is not visible that is called soul.
Every human being has a soul. And what is that soul? Our self; that to be explained further.
To say that, it is because of the self we able to speak out, we able to hear. If self is not
properly functioning then we are just material like a table and chair. When a human being
died and nothing remains, in that time the soul disappears. The soul detached from that body
therefore, after the death the body become as material as like table and chair. You hit the body
still the body has no reaction. Therefore they says that, all the system try to argue in their own
way that there is a soul exist in human being. Even all the animals who live in this earth, who
do some kind of activity and action in this earth. So, this is the way we understand what is a
human soul and what is self. If you ask now I believe that there are some questions may
becomes to your mind saying that, where the self is locating? For example, if somebody ask
where is my right hand. I can show my right hand but, if somebody ask where is your soul
locating. Then I could not able to see it, then I could not able to show it even; see this is my

soul. But, I can able to explain it, what is a soul, I mean and where it is really find, what is the
use of its soul. So, in this way we have to understand.
That means all the Indian philosophy system trying to say that if there is something existence,
it not only find in case of physical form, apart from that physical form also they are many
certain things which also equally important and also find in all this creatures or animals or
human being inside that and also act very prominently like as other physical part of their
body. So, that is kind of spiritual orientation that all trying to explain in their own way.
Now, coming to the next point that is closer to life, when we will say closer to life all the
orthodox system they believe as I said, the practice of the Vedanta, they believe the practice
of let us say, Veda, Gita, Upanishad, all these scriptures they believe. And they also thinks
that whatever action we are doing certainly at present, suppose I am able to speak something,
I able to identify something, it is already there in Gita and Upanishad. That is a old scripture,
still some essence we are now getting it and further when we saying that, closing to the life;
that means, whatever we do in our day to day activities, what we suppose to do and if
something we have done wrong also you can identify yes, this is not the perfect way of doing.
Suppose you are not respecting to our elders; that means, it is somewhere we are finding fault
with our self that yes, this is not the ethical practice.
And that is why all this scriptures in Indian system is close to our life. Now people say that,
now it is a life of modern life, I am in 21st century, everything works in a just click way in
internet. Still whatever we are doing some over the other, it is a find in a hidden form in Gita,
Upanishad and all these older scriptures.
While saying that, when orthodox people are claiming that all these are find in Gita and
Upanishad and all these old scripture, they know that, fully avoid that this scriptures are not
based on the words.
But rather these scriptures are based on the intuition. If this is so, the further claim that yes,
we all suggest, we all human beings are the seeker of this intuition because, once we get the
intuition or the power of intuition we can able to know what is going to happen in future and
what we are doing now. As a result we will be consider as a human being. And as a result, if
you know that this is the suffering, these are the pain, these are the attachment to the only
fears. So, we try to retry from that attachment or say only pleasure, as a result we get
happiness in our life.

So, these are all somehow comes to closer to our life because, day to day life we are facing
many problems and as a result if you do that kind of practice; practice for a yoga, practice for
a concentration, all this helps us to not only see the life in a very closer prospective rather to
understand many things in a very better way.
Now, I am reading out for your benefit. The classics of the Indian philosophy the Gita, the
Upanishad are not dissociated from human life. We have learnt many things from these
classics. Since we learn from our past hence past cannot be ignored or overlooked while
performing the present action.
So, the all I have elaborated in a very little manner. When all things will be getting more
discuss and with pure examples in our day to day life when we will be discussing the Vedanta
philosophy in a very clear manner or in other orthodox systems, coming to the next slides.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:05)

Now, if you see the spiritual dissatisfaction. What is a spiritual dissatisfaction? Say, as I said,
I am again repeating if you can now picturise what I have done this in the philosophical
system, orthodox and heterodox. Heterodox will be left side and orthodox will be right side.
He is saying that spiritual dissatisfaction, the heterodox people very clearly say that we do not
accept Veda. Nothing, nothing is lies in Veda but, still we get in a spiritual life. How you will
get it?

But orthodox people ask, how you get it? If you do not accept Veda or do not accept God,
how you can get it? Here if you find Buddhism, Jainism and Charvaka they said that, we all
are believer of spirit. Spirit here for us is a power, is an achievement, the goal that we are
seeking for.
As Buddha says that, there is a noble truth, four noble truth. Buddha says that the whole
world is full of pain, full of suffering, full of measuring but, there are every reasons to have
all these effect like sufferings, pain and seeking for pleasures. If you can know the root
causes where the pain lies then somehow other you understand this is the causes and I have to
address to that causes so that this causes will be eradicated as a result the effect also
eradicated.
Some people have craving towards getting, let us say, promotion. Suppose as a student also
you must have a craving that without studying anything you will get pass mark even also you
can also achieve many things without doing anything. Isn’t it? But, there Buddha says that
without labour, without effort nothing will available at free of cost.
If you do also, in later period you face problems and that problem nobody can help because
you have not understood middle steps of that. So, therefore, I am saying that there are
sufferings, many pains in whole our life. What you have to do with that, you have to know
what is the root causes of all the sufferings. If that is the spirit, if you know this, then you can
eradicate all the sufferings in your whole life, enhance. You will have a happy life because
you are detached from all these worldly pressure life.
However, you will get pleasure once you will find yourself as a reunion. You find your mind
is concentration. You identify what is a soul, where is your soul, who you are. All these you
can define yourself. Therefore, this kind of pleasure you’ll get it which is never find in case
of worldly pleasure.
Worldly pleasure has, what I mean is that, when you are very preplanning for getting a, let us
say, good bikes, good motorcycles, in a luxury items all this, it is a more than basic
necessities, it is called worldly pleasure. Now, if you it is, read that one that although, Buddha
and Jana do not prescribe this spiritual activities as astika do, but certainly they aim at for the
optimistic approach and removal of pessimism.

In majority, in most of the cases we find them moving toward happiness of life. They said,
also they recommend we get happiness in our life provided we must know that where
happiness lies. Until unless, we know where happiness lies we cannot get the happiness.
Rather we ignorantly consider the un-happiness either happiness. This is the spirit of
heterodox system. Now, if you see the last point that is, liberation is the ultimate end. What it
says is that, I am reading for you that, knowledge in Indian philosophy means divine
transformation of life and emancipation from worldly miseries. The second, it is spiritual
stage where human beings found themselves over and above the earthly attachments. Now, I
am elaborating further for your own understanding. Liberation is the ultimate end. People say
that, Oh! At last I liberated. Suppose you are trying to do something and at last you could able
to do it, you say that, Oh my God ! At last I got liberation; that means, everything is ever for
you. Now, if this is you understood now I am bringing that context to the philosophical
domain, in Indian philosophy. What it is saying that, Indian philosophical system saying that,
the whole life of a human being, when a baby burns start suffering....suffering.....suffering.
Because of many causes; it is not because of human or because of may be some social
conditions, cultural atmosphere, even the religious atmosphere, many other conditions,
economic background and many other condition, n number of condition that you know and it
varies from person to person.
If this is so, then you say that, once you know also the root causes how to get liberation from
that, what is the path of liberation? What did liberation means that? You identify the real
causes and try not to do further. So, that you get liberated.
To do the liberation there are many systems prescribed, there are many ways and differently.
This is happens just because as I said Indian philosophical system never popup in a one year
itself, it took so much, several year of traditions to come up, right. And there are many people
contributed for a particular system and hence for depend on their background, depend on
their understanding, they differ in opinion from person to person, even from system to
system.
But, however, the common essence lies that they all are trying to get liberate. Liberate from
suffering, liberate from all this pains, liberate from all this seeking of this material pleasure
and the liberation from the whole world.

That yes, I have a happily life because I liberate from all these. I do not need all this material
attachment. I as a human being, I need a basic necessity for my survival and I am happy to
that. The common ethical point what they want to highlight here is that suppose you are
doing some job you should be happy with that. Suppose you are getting something you
should be happy of that. But, your work should be continued further. If you think that in a
certain you’ll achieve many things and then you will fall in the trap that will be doing some
kind of unethical practice which leads you to gets so much problem in your life in the future
time.
So, therefore, try to be happy what you are first. Once you will be happy, feel happy within
yourself. So that, this is one of the liberation, you get it. Once you can do that you will feel
really your existence and you are yourself as a very pleasurly and happy person in this world
so that all suffering you never find inner whole life.
(Refer Slide Time: 23:40)

Now, coming to the next slides. Yeah! This is an ignorance. I said that before this slides also.
I said that because of ignorance many people suffer. Even there are many people in this
world, they do not know they are ignorant. The reason behind that, the reason is very clear
because they may not face many of the situations which they supposed to face. And also they
are ignorant because they may not see the world in a very complete form and hence for their
ignorance it is very crude way. If they will do some mistakes also they do not know what they
have to do.

Further, but still there is to hide that they do further mistakes. As a result what happens in
future they will be go on doing many mistakes because of their ignorance. And it is just
because of the ignorance they could not identify even what they have done wrong. If they
could haven’t identify in future they could not repeat the same thing but, as a result if
somebody can do that, somebody can properly identify what the unethical practices he or she
is doing, what is my ignorance? Where I have to learn further? Where I have to understand
further? If somebody can do that in future, these are the things, these are the miseries, these
are the sufferings never appears.
So, ignorance is the root cause of all suffering. If they are knowledgeable enough, if you can
understand what really lies for your suffering, for the causes of suffering that hopefully you
can eradicate that. That is a ignorance.
There are many people also ignorantly say that, we do not accept anything. All that they do
not know about that thing. It will be always better to know something, to understand
something, then you say that with your logical argument and also reasonable argument, say
that we are not accepting because of so and so reason.
In that case it is completely acceptable but, if you say that anything will be fine before you
ensure that I am not accepting. In this case it is just a fail from your side; that means, your
ignorant and you could not able to identify that you are doing some ignorant thing.
Hence for I suggest and also all the Indian philosophical systems subscribe that first of all as
a human being we should know that where we are ignorant, where we need to develop, where
we need to have more understanding. If you can do that then the life will be very peaceful
and you will get a very spiritual life.
Now, coming to the next slide. I said that now you understood there are six systems in Indian
philosophy. Out of six, three systems comes under heterodox who does not accept Veda and
another systems in a three pairs, you can say which comes under orthodox system who accept
Veda.
Now, we find what are the common features. So, that you can have a at least a very blue
sketching in your mind or a background kind of understanding what are the system is going
to tell about. So, therefore, I am saying common features of Indian philosophical systems
here I would like to bring you notice even that.
What I say common features of Indian philosophical system I never said Indian philosophical

So, therefore, this is your understanding you should be clear and confirm from this point. So,
that you would not be confused in later period. Now, you see that spiritual orientation. What

all the system, what I mean is that whenever describing some of the common points do not
think that that common point we find across orthodox and heterodox system.
What I am saying there may be cases that there are some commonality define between two
system, three system. There are also cases that some of the commonality define between four
systems but, do not consider whenever we are discussing the points one after another, do not
consider that whatever points you are discussing find in all the systems.
So, therefore, this is your understanding you should be clear and confirm from this point. So,
that you would not be confused in later period. Now, you see that spiritual orientation. What
is a spiritual orientation?

You might have gone to many of these Rushis, take some of this advice from him or her, or
anywhere. You go for a spiritual say temple or say church anywhere, you pray and all these,
this is spiritual. Because you think that this is the almighty where if I can create something,
can be, I can gain it. Isn’t it? If this is case then there are other systems.
It is both heterodox and orthodox somehow other, they accept that there is a spirit. Here what
I am saying spirit, do not understand, it is spirit as a God, spirit as a power; that means, they
said that all human being has a power; that means, God in the form of some or other form
exist in every human beings life.
Therefore we able to think, we able to act, we able to see, we able to do all the things rest and
all things which other animals cannot do. It is just because of God’s grace we able to do it,
that is called spiritual orientation. So, while doing that they are also explaining that, how soul
exist; see we are human being. What is a human being above all?
Human being is not just you know, the parts of body and mind. If this is so, somebody say
that here hand is a part, your leg is also a part. If you just detach from that or if by accident
you get some operation and somehow unfortunately it is should be deduct, still you will be a
human being. People will consider the human being.
Then what is a human being at all? It is a body or mind or something else. This question
comes repeatedly in all the systems. They say that human being also the major part, are the
very certain part which is not visible that is called soul.
Every human being has a soul. And what is that soul? Our self; that to be explained further.
To say that, it is because of the self we able to speak out, we able to hear. If self is not
properly functioning then we are just material like a table and chair. When a human being
died and nothing remains, in that time the soul disappears. The soul detached from that body
therefore, after the death the body become as material as like table and chair. You hit the body
still the body has no reaction. Therefore they says that, all the system try to argue in their own
way that there is a soul exist in human being. Even all the animals who live in this earth, who
do some kind of activity and action in this earth. So, this is the way we understand what is a
human soul and what is self. If you ask now I believe that there are some questions may
becomes to your mind saying that, where the self is locating? For example, if somebody ask
where is my right hand. I can show my right hand but, if somebody ask where is your soul
locating. Then I could not able to see it, then I could not able to show it even; see this is my

soul. But, I can able to explain it, what is a soul, I mean and where it is really find, what is the
use of its soul. So, in this way we have to understand.
That means all the Indian philosophy system trying to say that if there is something existence,
it not only find in case of physical form, apart from that physical form also they are many
certain things which also equally important and also find in all this creatures or animals or
human being inside that and also act very prominently like as other physical part of their
body. So, that is kind of spiritual orientation that all trying to explain in their own way.
Now, coming to the next point that is closer to life, when we will say closer to life all the
orthodox system they believe as I said, the practice of the Vedanta, they believe the practice
of let us say, Veda, Gita, Upanishad, all these scriptures they believe. And they also thinks
that whatever action we are doing certainly at present, suppose I am able to speak something,
I able to identify something, it is already there in Gita and Upanishad. That is a old scripture,
still some essence we are now getting it and further when we saying that, closing to the life;
that means, whatever we do in our day to day activities, what we suppose to do and if
something we have done wrong also you can identify yes, this is not the perfect way of doing.
Suppose you are not respecting to our elders; that means, it is somewhere we are finding fault
with our self that yes, this is not the ethical practice.
And that is why all this scriptures in Indian system is close to our life. Now people say that,
now it is a life of modern life, I am in 21st century, everything works in a just click way in
internet. Still whatever we are doing some over the other, it is a find in a hidden form in Gita,
Upanishad and all these older scriptures.
While saying that, when orthodox people are claiming that all these are find in Gita and
Upanishad and all these old scripture, they know that, fully avoid that this scriptures are not
based on the words.
But rather these scriptures are based on the intuition. If this is so, the further claim that yes,
we all suggest, we all human beings are the seeker of this intuition because, once we get the
intuition or the power of intuition we can able to know what is going to happen in future and
what we are doing now. As a result we will be consider as a human being. And as a result, if
you know that this is the suffering, these are the pain, these are the attachment to the only
fears. So, we try to retry from that attachment or say only pleasure, as a result we get
happiness in our life.

So, these are all somehow comes to closer to our life because, day to day life we are facing
many problems and as a result if you do that kind of practice; practice for a yoga, practice for
a concentration, all this helps us to not only see the life in a very closer prospective rather to
understand many things in a very better way.
Now, I am reading out for your benefit. The classics of the Indian philosophy the Gita, the
Upanishad are not dissociated from human life. We have learnt many things from these
classics. Since we learn from our past hence past cannot be ignored or overlooked while
performing the present action.
So, the all I have elaborated in a very little manner. When all things will be getting more
discuss and with pure examples in our day to day life when we will be discussing the Vedanta
philosophy in a very clear manner or in other orthodox systems, coming to the next slides.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:05)

Now, if you see the spiritual dissatisfaction. What is a spiritual dissatisfaction? Say, as I said,
I am again repeating if you can now picturise what I have done this in the philosophical
system, orthodox and heterodox. Heterodox will be left side and orthodox will be right side.
He is saying that spiritual dissatisfaction, the heterodox people very clearly say that we do not
accept Veda. Nothing, nothing is lies in Veda but, still we get in a spiritual life. How you will
get it?

But orthodox people ask, how you get it? If you do not accept Veda or do not accept God,
how you can get it? Here if you find Buddhism, Jainism and Charvaka they said that, we all
are believer of spirit. Spirit here for us is a power, is an achievement, the goal that we are
seeking for.
As Buddha says that, there is a noble truth, four noble truth. Buddha says that the whole
world is full of pain, full of suffering, full of measuring but, there are every reasons to have
all these effect like sufferings, pain and seeking for pleasures. If you can know the root
causes where the pain lies then somehow other you understand this is the causes and I have to
address to that causes so that this causes will be eradicated as a result the effect also
eradicated.
Some people have craving towards getting, let us say, promotion. Suppose as a student also
you must have a craving that without studying anything you will get pass mark even also you
can also achieve many things without doing anything. Isn’t it? But, there Buddha says that
without labour, without effort nothing will available at free of cost.
If you do also, in later period you face problems and that problem nobody can help because
you have not understood middle steps of that. So, therefore, I am saying that there are
sufferings, many pains in whole our life. What you have to do with that, you have to know
what is the root causes of all the sufferings. If that is the spirit, if you know this, then you can
eradicate all the sufferings in your whole life, enhance. You will have a happy life because
you are detached from all these worldly pressure life.
However, you will get pleasure once you will find yourself as a reunion. You find your mind
is concentration. You identify what is a soul, where is your soul, who you are. All these you
can define yourself. Therefore, this kind of pleasure you’ll get it which is never find in case
of worldly pleasure.
Worldly pleasure has, what I mean is that, when you are very preplanning for getting a, let us
say, good bikes, good motorcycles, in a luxury items all this, it is a more than basic
necessities, it is called worldly pleasure. Now, if you it is, read that one that although, Buddha
and Jana do not prescribe this spiritual activities as astika do, but certainly they aim at for the
optimistic approach and removal of pessimism.

In majority, in most of the cases we find them moving toward happiness of life. They said,
also they recommend we get happiness in our life provided we must know that where
happiness lies. Until unless, we know where happiness lies we cannot get the happiness.
Rather we ignorantly consider the un-happiness either happiness. This is the spirit of
heterodox system. Now, if you see the last point that is, liberation is the ultimate end. What it
says is that, I am reading for you that, knowledge in Indian philosophy means divine
transformation of life and emancipation from worldly miseries. The second, it is spiritual
stage where human beings found themselves over and above the earthly attachments. Now, I
am elaborating further for your own understanding. Liberation is the ultimate end. People say
that, Oh! At last I liberated. Suppose you are trying to do something and at last you could able
to do it, you say that, Oh my God ! At last I got liberation; that means, everything is ever for
you. Now, if this is you understood now I am bringing that context to the philosophical
domain, in Indian philosophy. What it is saying that, Indian philosophical system saying that,
the whole life of a human being, when a baby burns start suffering....suffering.....suffering.
Because of many causes; it is not because of human or because of may be some social
conditions, cultural atmosphere, even the religious atmosphere, many other conditions,
economic background and many other condition, n number of condition that you know and it
varies from person to person.
If this is so, then you say that, once you know also the root causes how to get liberation from
that, what is the path of liberation? What did liberation means that? You identify the real
causes and try not to do further. So, that you get liberated.
To do the liberation there are many systems prescribed, there are many ways and differently.
This is happens just because as I said Indian philosophical system never popup in a one year
itself, it took so much, several year of traditions to come up, right. And there are many people
contributed for a particular system and hence for depend on their background, depend on
their understanding, they differ in opinion from person to person, even from system to
system.
But, however, the common essence lies that they all are trying to get liberate. Liberate from
suffering, liberate from all this pains, liberate from all this seeking of this material pleasure
and the liberation from the whole world.

That yes, I have a happily life because I liberate from all these. I do not need all this material
attachment. I as a human being, I need a basic necessity for my survival and I am happy to
that. The common ethical point what they want to highlight here is that suppose you are
doing some job you should be happy with that. Suppose you are getting something you
should be happy of that. But, your work should be continued further. If you think that in a
certain you’ll achieve many things and then you will fall in the trap that will be doing some
kind of unethical practice which leads you to gets so much problem in your life in the future
time.
So, therefore, try to be happy what you are first. Once you will be happy, feel happy within
yourself. So that, this is one of the liberation, you get it. Once you can do that you will feel
really your existence and you are yourself as a very pleasurly and happy person in this world
so that all suffering you never find inner whole life.

Now, coming to the next slides. Yeah! This is an ignorance. I said that before this slides also.
I said that because of ignorance many people suffer. Even there are many people in this
world, they do not know they are ignorant. The reason behind that, the reason is very clear
because they may not face many of the situations which they supposed to face. And also they
are ignorant because they may not see the world in a very complete form and hence for their
ignorance it is very crude way. If they will do some mistakes also they do not know what they
have to do.

Further, but still there is to hide that they do further mistakes. As a result what happens in
future they will be go on doing many mistakes because of their ignorance. And it is just
because of the ignorance they could not identify even what they have done wrong. If they
could haven’t identify in future they could not repeat the same thing but, as a result if
somebody can do that, somebody can properly identify what the unethical practices he or she
is doing, what is my ignorance? Where I have to learn further? Where I have to understand
further? If somebody can do that in future, these are the things, these are the miseries, these
are the sufferings never appears.
So, ignorance is the root cause of all suffering. If they are knowledgeable enough, if you can
understand what really lies for your suffering, for the causes of suffering that hopefully you
can eradicate that. That is a ignorance.
There are many people also ignorantly say that, we do not accept anything. All that they do
not know about that thing. It will be always better to know something, to understand
something, then you say that with your logical argument and also reasonable argument, say
that we are not accepting because of so and so reason.
In that case it is completely acceptable but, if you say that anything will be fine before you
ensure that I am not accepting. In this case it is just a fail from your side; that means, your
ignorant and you could not able to identify that you are doing some ignorant thing.
Hence for I suggest and also all the Indian philosophical systems subscribe that first of all as
a human being we should know that where we are ignorant, where we need to develop, where
we need to have more understanding. If you can do that then the life will be very peaceful
and you will get a very spiritual life.
Now, coming to the next slide. I said that now you understood there are six systems in Indian
philosophy. Out of six, three systems comes under heterodox who does not accept Veda and
another systems in a three pairs, you can say which comes under orthodox system who accept
Veda.
Now, we find what are the common features. So, that you can have a at least a very blue
sketching in your mind or a background kind of understanding what are the system is going
to tell about. So, therefore, I am saying common features of Indian philosophical systems
here I would like to bring you notice even that.
What I say common features of Indian philosophical system I never said Indian philosophical
all the system, what I mean is that whenever describing some of the common points do not

that you would not be confused in later period. Now, you see that spiritual orientation. What

What I am saying there may be cases that there are some commonality define between two
system, three system. There are also cases that some of the commonality define between four
systems but, do not consider whenever we are discussing the points one after another, do not
consider that whatever points you are discussing find in all the systems.
So, therefore, this is your understanding you should be clear and confirm from this point. So,
that you would not be confused in later period. Now, you see that spiritual orientation. What
is a spiritual orientation?

You might have gone to many of these Rushis, take some of this advice from him or her, or
anywhere. You go for a spiritual say temple or say church anywhere, you pray and all these,
this is spiritual. Because you think that this is the almighty where if I can create something,
can be, I can gain it. Isn’t it? If this is case then there are other systems.
It is both heterodox and orthodox somehow other, they accept that there is a spirit. Here what
I am saying spirit, do not understand, it is spirit as a God, spirit as a power; that means, they
said that all human being has a power; that means, God in the form of some or other form
exist in every human beings life.
Therefore we able to think, we able to act, we able to see, we able to do all the things rest and
all things which other animals cannot do. It is just because of God’s grace we able to do it,
that is called spiritual orientation. So, while doing that they are also explaining that, how soul
exist; see we are human being. What is a human being above all?
Human being is not just you know, the parts of body and mind. If this is so, somebody say
that here hand is a part, your leg is also a part. If you just detach from that or if by accident
you get some operation and somehow unfortunately it is should be deduct, still you will be a
human being. People will consider the human being.
Then what is a human being at all? It is a body or mind or something else. This question
comes repeatedly in all the systems. They say that human being also the major part, are the
very certain part which is not visible that is called soul.
Every human being has a soul. And what is that soul? Our self; that to be explained further.
To say that, it is because of the self we able to speak out, we able to hear. If self is not
properly functioning then we are just material like a table and chair. When a human being
died and nothing remains, in that time the soul disappears. The soul detached from that body
therefore, after the death the body become as material as like table and chair. You hit the body
still the body has no reaction. Therefore they says that, all the system try to argue in their own
way that there is a soul exist in human being. Even all the animals who live in this earth, who
do some kind of activity and action in this earth. So, this is the way we understand what is a
human soul and what is self. If you ask now I believe that there are some questions may
becomes to your mind saying that, where the self is locating? For example, if somebody ask
where is my right hand. I can show my right hand but, if somebody ask where is your soul
locating. Then I could not able to see it, then I could not able to show it even; see this is my

soul. But, I can able to explain it, what is a soul, I mean and where it is really find, what is the
use of its soul. So, in this way we have to understand.
That means all the Indian philosophy system trying to say that if there is something existence,
it not only find in case of physical form, apart from that physical form also they are many
certain things which also equally important and also find in all this creatures or animals or
human being inside that and also act very prominently like as other physical part of their
body. So, that is kind of spiritual orientation that all trying to explain in their own way.
Now, coming to the next point that is closer to life, when we will say closer to life all the
orthodox system they believe as I said, the practice of the Vedanta, they believe the practice
of let us say, Veda, Gita, Upanishad, all these scriptures they believe. And they also thinks
that whatever action we are doing certainly at present, suppose I am able to speak something,
I able to identify something, it is already there in Gita and Upanishad. That is a old scripture,
still some essence we are now getting it and further when we saying that, closing to the life;
that means, whatever we do in our day to day activities, what we suppose to do and if
something we have done wrong also you can identify yes, this is not the perfect way of doing.
Suppose you are not respecting to our elders; that means, it is somewhere we are finding fault
with our self that yes, this is not the ethical practice.
And that is why all this scriptures in Indian system is close to our life. Now people say that,
now it is a life of modern life, I am in 21st century, everything works in a just click way in
internet. Still whatever we are doing some over the other, it is a find in a hidden form in Gita,
Upanishad and all these older scriptures.
While saying that, when orthodox people are claiming that all these are find in Gita and
Upanishad and all these old scripture, they know that, fully avoid that this scriptures are not
based on the words.
But rather these scriptures are based on the intuition. If this is so, the further claim that yes,
we all suggest, we all human beings are the seeker of this intuition because, once we get the
intuition or the power of intuition we can able to know what is going to happen in future and
what we are doing now. As a result we will be consider as a human being. And as a result, if
you know that this is the suffering, these are the pain, these are the attachment to the only
fears. So, we try to retry from that attachment or say only pleasure, as a result we get
happiness in our life.

So, these are all somehow comes to closer to our life because, day to day life we are facing
many problems and as a result if you do that kind of practice; practice for a yoga, practice for
a concentration, all this helps us to not only see the life in a very closer prospective rather to
understand many things in a very better way.
Now, I am reading out for your benefit. The classics of the Indian philosophy the Gita, the
Upanishad are not dissociated from human life. We have learnt many things from these
classics. Since we learn from our past hence past cannot be ignored or overlooked while
performing the present action.
So, the all I have elaborated in a very little manner. When all things will be getting more
discuss and with pure examples in our day to day life when we will be discussing the Vedanta
philosophy in a very clear manner or in other orthodox systems, coming to the next slides.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:05)

Now, if you see the spiritual dissatisfaction. What is a spiritual dissatisfaction? Say, as I said,
I am again repeating if you can now picturise what I have done this in the philosophical
system, orthodox and heterodox. Heterodox will be left side and orthodox will be right side.
He is saying that spiritual dissatisfaction, the heterodox people very clearly say that we do not
accept Veda. Nothing, nothing is lies in Veda but, still we get in a spiritual life. How you will
get it?

But orthodox people ask, how you get it? If you do not accept Veda or do not accept God,
how you can get it? Here if you find Buddhism, Jainism and Charvaka they said that, we all
are believer of spirit. Spirit here for us is a power, is an achievement, the goal that we are
seeking for.
As Buddha says that, there is a noble truth, four noble truth. Buddha says that the whole
world is full of pain, full of suffering, full of measuring but, there are every reasons to have
all these effect like sufferings, pain and seeking for pleasures. If you can know the root
causes where the pain lies then somehow other you understand this is the causes and I have to
address to that causes so that this causes will be eradicated as a result the effect also
eradicated.
Some people have craving towards getting, let us say, promotion. Suppose as a student also
you must have a craving that without studying anything you will get pass mark even also you
can also achieve many things without doing anything. Isn’t it? But, there Buddha says that
without labour, without effort nothing will available at free of cost.
If you do also, in later period you face problems and that problem nobody can help because
you have not understood middle steps of that. So, therefore, I am saying that there are
sufferings, many pains in whole our life. What you have to do with that, you have to know
what is the root causes of all the sufferings. If that is the spirit, if you know this, then you can
eradicate all the sufferings in your whole life, enhance. You will have a happy life because
you are detached from all these worldly pressure life.
However, you will get pleasure once you will find yourself as a reunion. You find your mind
is concentration. You identify what is a soul, where is your soul, who you are. All these you
can define yourself. Therefore, this kind of pleasure you’ll get it which is never find in case
of worldly pleasure.
Worldly pleasure has, what I mean is that, when you are very preplanning for getting a, let us
say, good bikes, good motorcycles, in a luxury items all this, it is a more than basic
necessities, it is called worldly pleasure. Now, if you it is, read that one that although, Buddha
and Jana do not prescribe this spiritual activities as astika do, but certainly they aim at for the
optimistic approach and removal of pessimism.

In majority, in most of the cases we find them moving toward happiness of life. They said,
also they recommend we get happiness in our life provided we must know that where
happiness lies. Until unless, we know where happiness lies we cannot get the happiness.
Rather we ignorantly consider the un-happiness either happiness. This is the spirit of
heterodox system. Now, if you see the last point that is, liberation is the ultimate end. What it
says is that, I am reading for you that, knowledge in Indian philosophy means divine
transformation of life and emancipation from worldly miseries. The second, it is spiritual
stage where human beings found themselves over and above the earthly attachments. Now, I
am elaborating further for your own understanding. Liberation is the ultimate end. People say
that, Oh! At last I liberated. Suppose you are trying to do something and at last you could able
to do it, you say that, Oh my God ! At last I got liberation; that means, everything is ever for
you. Now, if this is you understood now I am bringing that context to the philosophical
domain, in Indian philosophy. What it is saying that, Indian philosophical system saying that,
the whole life of a human being, when a baby burns start suffering....suffering.....suffering.
Because of many causes; it is not because of human or because of may be some social
conditions, cultural atmosphere, even the religious atmosphere, many other conditions,
economic background and many other condition, n number of condition that you know and it
varies from person to person.
If this is so, then you say that, once you know also the root causes how to get liberation from
that, what is the path of liberation? What did liberation means that? You identify the real
causes and try not to do further. So, that you get liberated.
To do the liberation there are many systems prescribed, there are many ways and differently.
This is happens just because as I said Indian philosophical system never popup in a one year
itself, it took so much, several year of traditions to come up, right. And there are many people
contributed for a particular system and hence for depend on their background, depend on
their understanding, they differ in opinion from person to person, even from system to
system.
But, however, the common essence lies that they all are trying to get liberate. Liberate from
suffering, liberate from all this pains, liberate from all this seeking of this material pleasure
and the liberation from the whole world.

That yes, I have a happily life because I liberate from all these. I do not need all this material
attachment. I as a human being, I need a basic necessity for my survival and I am happy to
that. The common ethical point what they want to highlight here is that suppose you are
doing some job you should be happy with that. Suppose you are getting something you
should be happy of that. But, your work should be continued further. If you think that in a
certain you’ll achieve many things and then you will fall in the trap that will be doing some
kind of unethical practice which leads you to gets so much problem in your life in the future
time.
So, therefore, try to be happy what you are first. Once you will be happy, feel happy within
yourself. So that, this is one of the liberation, you get it. Once you can do that you will feel
really your existence and you are yourself as a very pleasurly and happy person in this world
so that all suffering you never find inner whole life.
(Refer Slide Time: 23:40)

Now, coming to the next slides. Yeah! This is an ignorance. I said that before this slides also.
I said that because of ignorance many people suffer. Even there are many people in this
world, they do not know they are ignorant. The reason behind that, the reason is very clear
because they may not face many of the situations which they supposed to face. And also they
are ignorant because they may not see the world in a very complete form and hence for their
ignorance it is very crude way. If they will do some mistakes also they do not know what they
have to do.

Further, but still there is to hide that they do further mistakes. As a result what happens in
future they will be go on doing many mistakes because of their ignorance. And it is just
because of the ignorance they could not identify even what they have done wrong. If they
could haven’t identify in future they could not repeat the same thing but, as a result if
somebody can do that, somebody can properly identify what the unethical practices he or she
is doing, what is my ignorance? Where I have to learn further? Where I have to understand
further? If somebody can do that in future, these are the things, these are the miseries, these
are the sufferings never appears.
So, ignorance is the root cause of all suffering. If they are knowledgeable enough, if you can
understand what really lies for your suffering, for the causes of suffering that hopefully you
can eradicate that. That is a ignorance.
There are many people also ignorantly say that, we do not accept anything. All that they do
not know about that thing. It will be always better to know something, to understand
something, then you say that with your logical argument and also reasonable argument, say
that we are not accepting because of so and so reason.
In that case it is completely acceptable but, if you say that anything will be fine before you
ensure that I am not accepting. In this case it is just a fail from your side; that means, your
ignorant and you could not able to identify that you are doing some ignorant thing.
Hence for I suggest and also all the Indian philosophical systems subscribe that first of all as
a human being we should know that where we are ignorant, where we need to develop, where
we need to have more understanding. If you can do that then the life will be very peaceful
and you will get a very spiritual life.
Now, coming to the next slide. I said that now you understood there are six systems in Indian
philosophy. Out of six, three systems comes under heterodox who does not accept Veda and
another systems in a three pairs, you can say which comes under orthodox system who accept
Veda.
Now, we find what are the common features. So, that you can have a at least a very blue
sketching in your mind or a background kind of understanding what are the system is going
to tell about. So, therefore, I am saying common features of Indian philosophical systems
here I would like to bring you notice even that.
What I say common features of Indian philosophical system I never said Indian philosophical
all the system, what I mean is that whenever describing some of the common points do not
think that that common point we find across orthodox and heterodox system.
What I am saying there may be cases that there are some commonality define between two
system, three system. There are also cases that some of the commonality define between four
systems but, do not consider whenever we are discussing the points one after another, do not
consider that whatever points you are discussing find in all the systems.
So, therefore, this is your understanding you should be clear and confirm from this point. So,
that you would not be confused in later period. Now, you see that spiritual orientation. What
is a spiritual orientation?

You might have gone to many of these Rushis, take some of this advice from him or her, or

system, three system. There are also cases that some of the commonality define between four
systems but, do not consider whenever we are discussing the points one after another, do not
consider that whatever points you are discussing find in all the systems.
So, therefore, this is your understanding you should be clear and confirm from this point. So,
that you would not be confused in later period. Now, you see that spiritual orientation. What
is a spiritual orientation?

You might have gone to many of these Rushis, take some of this advice from him or her, or
anywhere. You go for a spiritual say temple or say church anywhere, you pray and all these,
this is spiritual. Because you think that this is the almighty where if I can create something,
can be, I can gain it. Isn’t it? If this is case then there are other systems.
It is both heterodox and orthodox somehow other, they accept that there is a spirit. Here what
I am saying spirit, do not understand, it is spirit as a God, spirit as a power; that means, they
said that all human being has a power; that means, God in the form of some or other form
exist in every human beings life.
Therefore we able to think, we able to act, we able to see, we able to do all the things rest and
all things which other animals cannot do. It is just because of God’s grace we able to do it,
that is called spiritual orientation. So, while doing that they are also explaining that, how soul
exist; see we are human being. What is a human being above all?
Human being is not just you know, the parts of body and mind. If this is so, somebody say
that here hand is a part, your leg is also a part. If you just detach from that or if by accident
you get some operation and somehow unfortunately it is should be deduct, still you will be a
human being. People will consider the human being.
Then what is a human being at all? It is a body or mind or something else. This question
comes repeatedly in all the systems. They say that human being also the major part, are the
very certain part which is not visible that is called soul.
Every human being has a soul. And what is that soul? Our self; that to be explained further.
To say that, it is because of the self we able to speak out, we able to hear. If self is not
properly functioning then we are just material like a table and chair. When a human being
died and nothing remains, in that time the soul disappears. The soul detached from that body
therefore, after the death the body become as material as like table and chair. You hit the body
still the body has no reaction. Therefore they says that, all the system try to argue in their own
way that there is a soul exist in human being. Even all the animals who live in this earth, who
do some kind of activity and action in this earth. So, this is the way we understand what is a
human soul and what is self. If you ask now I believe that there are some questions may
becomes to your mind saying that, where the self is locating? For example, if somebody ask
where is my right hand. I can show my right hand but, if somebody ask where is your soul
locating. Then I could not able to see it, then I could not able to show it even; see this is my

soul. But, I can able to explain it, what is a soul, I mean and where it is really find, what is the
use of its soul. So, in this way we have to understand.
That means all the Indian philosophy system trying to say that if there is something existence,
it not only find in case of physical form, apart from that physical form also they are many
certain things which also equally important and also find in all this creatures or animals or
human being inside that and also act very prominently like as other physical part of their
body. So, that is kind of spiritual orientation that all trying to explain in their own way.
Now, coming to the next point that is closer to life, when we will say closer to life all the
orthodox system they believe as I said, the practice of the Vedanta, they believe the practice
of let us say, Veda, Gita, Upanishad, all these scriptures they believe. And they also thinks
that whatever action we are doing certainly at present, suppose I am able to speak something,
I able to identify something, it is already there in Gita and Upanishad. That is a old scripture,
still some essence we are now getting it and further when we saying that, closing to the life;
that means, whatever we do in our day to day activities, what we suppose to do and if
something we have done wrong also you can identify yes, this is not the perfect way of doing.
Suppose you are not respecting to our elders; that means, it is somewhere we are finding fault
with our self that yes, this is not the ethical practice.
And that is why all this scriptures in Indian system is close to our life. Now people say that,
now it is a life of modern life, I am in 21st century, everything works in a just click way in
internet. Still whatever we are doing some over the other, it is a find in a hidden form in Gita,
Upanishad and all these older scriptures.
While saying that, when orthodox people are claiming that all these are find in Gita and
Upanishad and all these old scripture, they know that, fully avoid that this scriptures are not
based on the words.
But rather these scriptures are based on the intuition. If this is so, the further claim that yes,
we all suggest, we all human beings are the seeker of this intuition because, once we get the
intuition or the power of intuition we can able to know what is going to happen in future and
what we are doing now. As a result we will be consider as a human being. And as a result, if
you know that this is the suffering, these are the pain, these are the attachment to the only
fears. So, we try to retry from that attachment or say only pleasure, as a result we get
happiness in our life.

So, these are all somehow comes to closer to our life because, day to day life we are facing
many problems and as a result if you do that kind of practice; practice for a yoga, practice for
a concentration, all this helps us to not only see the life in a very closer prospective rather to
understand many things in a very better way.
Now, I am reading out for your benefit. The classics of the Indian philosophy the Gita, the
Upanishad are not dissociated from human life. We have learnt many things from these
classics. Since we learn from our past hence past cannot be ignored or overlooked while
performing the present action.
So, the all I have elaborated in a very little manner. When all things will be getting more
discuss and with pure examples in our day to day life when we will be discussing the Vedanta
philosophy in a very clear manner or in other orthodox systems, coming to the next slides.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:05)

Now, if you see the spiritual dissatisfaction. What is a spiritual dissatisfaction? Say, as I said,
I am again repeating if you can now picturise what I have done this in the philosophical
system, orthodox and heterodox. Heterodox will be left side and orthodox will be right side.
He is saying that spiritual dissatisfaction, the heterodox people very clearly say that we do not
accept Veda. Nothing, nothing is lies in Veda but, still we get in a spiritual life. How you will
get it?

But orthodox people ask, how you get it? If you do not accept Veda or do not accept God,
how you can get it? Here if you find Buddhism, Jainism and Charvaka they said that, we all
are believer of spirit. Spirit here for us is a power, is an achievement, the goal that we are
seeking for.
As Buddha says that, there is a noble truth, four noble truth. Buddha says that the whole
world is full of pain, full of suffering, full of measuring but, there are every reasons to have
all these effect like sufferings, pain and seeking for pleasures. If you can know the root
causes where the pain lies then somehow other you understand this is the causes and I have to
address to that causes so that this causes will be eradicated as a result the effect also
eradicated.
Some people have craving towards getting, let us say, promotion. Suppose as a student also
you must have a craving that without studying anything you will get pass mark even also you
can also achieve many things without doing anything. Isn’t it? But, there Buddha says that
without labour, without effort nothing will available at free of cost.
If you do also, in later period you face problems and that problem nobody can help because
you have not understood middle steps of that. So, therefore, I am saying that there are
sufferings, many pains in whole our life. What you have to do with that, you have to know
what is the root causes of all the sufferings. If that is the spirit, if you know this, then you can
eradicate all the sufferings in your whole life, enhance. You will have a happy life because
you are detached from all these worldly pressure life.
However, you will get pleasure once you will find yourself as a reunion. You find your mind
is concentration. You identify what is a soul, where is your soul, who you are. All these you
can define yourself. Therefore, this kind of pleasure you’ll get it which is never find in case
of worldly pleasure.
Worldly pleasure has, what I mean is that, when you are very preplanning for getting a, let us
say, good bikes, good motorcycles, in a luxury items all this, it is a more than basic
necessities, it is called worldly pleasure. Now, if you it is, read that one that although, Buddha
and Jana do not prescribe this spiritual activities as astika do, but certainly they aim at for the
optimistic approach and removal of pessimism.

In majority, in most of the cases we find them moving toward happiness of life. They said,
also they recommend we get happiness in our life provided we must know that where
happiness lies. Until unless, we know where happiness lies we cannot get the happiness.
Rather we ignorantly consider the un-happiness either happiness. This is the spirit of
heterodox system. Now, if you see the last point that is, liberation is the ultimate end. What it
says is that, I am reading for you that, knowledge in Indian philosophy means divine
transformation of life and emancipation from worldly miseries. The second, it is spiritual
stage where human beings found themselves over and above the earthly attachments. Now, I
am elaborating further for your own understanding. Liberation is the ultimate end. People say
that, Oh! At last I liberated. Suppose you are trying to do something and at last you could able
to do it, you say that, Oh my God ! At last I got liberation; that means, everything is ever for
you. Now, if this is you understood now I am bringing that context to the philosophical
domain, in Indian philosophy. What it is saying that, Indian philosophical system saying that,
the whole life of a human being, when a baby burns start suffering....suffering.....suffering.
Because of many causes; it is not because of human or because of may be some social
conditions, cultural atmosphere, even the religious atmosphere, many other conditions,
economic background and many other condition, n number of condition that you know and it
varies from person to person.
If this is so, then you say that, once you know also the root causes how to get liberation from
that, what is the path of liberation? What did liberation means that? You identify the real
causes and try not to do further. So, that you get liberated.
To do the liberation there are many systems prescribed, there are many ways and differently.
This is happens just because as I said Indian philosophical system never popup in a one year
itself, it took so much, several year of traditions to come up, right. And there are many people
contributed for a particular system and hence for depend on their background, depend on
their understanding, they differ in opinion from person to person, even from system to
system.
But, however, the common essence lies that they all are trying to get liberate. Liberate from
suffering, liberate from all this pains, liberate from all this seeking of this material pleasure
and the liberation from the whole world.

That yes, I have a happily life because I liberate from all these. I do not need all this material
attachment. I as a human being, I need a basic necessity for my survival and I am happy to
that. The common ethical point what they want to highlight here is that suppose you are
doing some job you should be happy with that. Suppose you are getting something you
should be happy of that. But, your work should be continued further. If you think that in a
certain you’ll achieve many things and then you will fall in the trap that will be doing some
kind of unethical practice which leads you to gets so much problem in your life in the future
time.
So, therefore, try to be happy what you are first. Once you will be happy, feel happy within
yourself. So that, this is one of the liberation, you get it. Once you can do that you will feel
really your existence and you are yourself as a very pleasurly and happy person in this world
so that all suffering you never find inner whole life.
(Refer Slide Time: 23:40)

Now, coming to the next slides. Yeah! This is an ignorance. I said that before this slides also.
I said that because of ignorance many people suffer. Even there are many people in this
world, they do not know they are ignorant. The reason behind that, the reason is very clear
because they may not face many of the situations which they supposed to face. And also they
are ignorant because they may not see the world in a very complete form and hence for their
ignorance it is very crude way. If they will do some mistakes also they do not know what they
have to do.

Further, but still there is to hide that they do further mistakes. As a result what happens in
future they will be go on doing many mistakes because of their ignorance. And it is just
because of the ignorance they could not identify even what they have done wrong. If they
could haven’t identify in future they could not repeat the same thing but, as a result if
somebody can do that, somebody can properly identify what the unethical practices he or she
is doing, what is my ignorance? Where I have to learn further? Where I have to understand
further? If somebody can do that in future, these are the things, these are the miseries, these
are the sufferings never appears.
So, ignorance is the root cause of all suffering. If they are knowledgeable enough, if you can
understand what really lies for your suffering, for the causes of suffering that hopefully you
can eradicate that. That is a ignorance.
There are many people also ignorantly say that, we do not accept anything. All that they do
not know about that thing. It will be always better to know something, to understand
something, then you say that with your logical argument and also reasonable argument, say
that we are not accepting because of so and so reason.
In that case it is completely acceptable but, if you say that anything will be fine before you
ensure that I am not accepting. In this case it is just a fail from your side; that means, your
ignorant and you could not able to identify that you are doing some ignorant thing.
Hence for I suggest and also all the Indian philosophical systems subscribe that first of all as
a human being we should know that where we are ignorant, where we need to develop, where
we need to have more understanding. If you can do that then the life will be very peaceful
and you will get a very spiritual life.
Now, coming to the next slide. I said that now you understood there are six systems in Indian
philosophy. Out of six, three systems comes under heterodox who does not accept Veda and
another systems in a three pairs, you can say which comes under orthodox system who accept
Veda.
Now, we find what are the common features. So, that you can have a at least a very blue
sketching in your mind or a background kind of understanding what are the system is going
to tell about. So, therefore, I am saying common features of Indian philosophical systems
here I would like to bring you notice even that.
What I say common features of Indian philosophical system I never said Indian philosophical
all the system, what I mean is that whenever describing some of the common points do not
think that that common point we find across orthodox and heterodox system.
What I am saying there may be cases that there are some commonality define between two
system, three system. There are also cases that some of the commonality define between four
systems but, do not consider whenever we are discussing the points one after another, do not
consider that whatever points you are discussing find in all the systems.
So, therefore, this is your understanding you should be clear and confirm from this point. So,
that you would not be confused in later period. Now, you see that spiritual orientation. What
is a spiritual orientation?

You might have gone to many of these Rushis, take some of this advice from him or her, or

this is spiritual. Because you think that this is the almighty where if I can create something,

as ignorance. As a result they suffer in their life in various ways. Buddhism and Vedanta
philosophy they are they find that what are the root causes of suffering.

(Refer Slide Time: 26:27)

And they also claim that it is a ignorance, because of ignorance we suffer and they also argue
that how to eradicate from that ignorance. Now, practice of yoga for moksa. When you have,
you know that you have done so much things in your life and you also get some pleasure in
your life but, at the last you realize that all these are just myth, is no reality find in that. So,
therefore, all the systems, they try to convince that there is a moksa, everyone tries to achieve
it, everyone tries to get it in a different form not in a same form. All the system have a
different opinion on trying to get moksa. When we said that, we all are seeker of mochas,
then question arises, how you will get moksa? Is it possible? What is it really about moksa?
Then, they said that this practice of yoga can leads us to get moksa. Yoga is a, it is a particular
school of thought. When we will be discussing yoga philosophy we will discussing there are
different stages. So, which a human being should go through as a result, the last stage human
being can get moksa. And moksa may be in this life. It is not after our death. The liberation
people can also get in this life if somebody can understand what is a real cause of suffering
and how to get moksa, what the spiritual practice one suppose to do to get moksa and how do
you know that which stage; here you see is and what are the stage suppose to be crossed to
get the moksa. If this is all the case then a person will be very happy enough in this world.
And all this will be we find in the discussion of yoga philosophy.
The practice of yoga for moksa. Then it said that, the practice of yoga help for removing the
psychological and spiritual ignorance of individuals. The 8 fold yoga that will be discussing

in the yoga philosophy, when we discuss yoga philosophy or Patanjali regards by all the
systems yoga, whatever described the practice of yoga, all the systems somehow other
respect to that and do not accepted each steps but, somehow other, whether in a gross former,
mild former accept that is some kind of yoga we must do it, we must practice it to achieve our
goal, to achieve our aim and also dissatisfy with our self.
Now the last point that you can see in my slide is that, to bring the positive changes in life is
the aim of spiritual practice. What is the positive changes? Because, as we know that, now we
are not able to concentrate particularly hence, for since, we are not able to concentrate
particularly, our mind is fluctuating from one to another as a result, we could not concentrate
on a particular point and if since we could not able to do that the achievement for us, the
attainment for us it says very minor one and as a result we could not able to properly know
what we are doing it.
While doing a particular things sometimes our mind diverted to another things. And it
happens because we are associating with different activities. Here, yoga saying that if you do
some kind of practice you could able to concentrate in a particular task though you have an
equally other important task are lies with you. And if you do slowly one after another, the
system prescribe that everything you can do on time and for that only you need a time
management skills. If you can develop the time management skills and you can concentrate
on a particular task you can able to do it. And all things will be for easier for you but, if you
cannot concentrate on a particular task everything will get diverted as a result even a single
thing you cannot do successfully.

Now, come to the next slides. The psychological basis. I am just reading out first then I will
be discussing further. From Buddha to Patanjali, Buddhism as well as also yoga philosophy,
even Sankara and Ramanuja who also comes under Vedanta philosophy all are emphasized
the psychological aspect of philosophy.
Yogic exercises are prescribed to cure the physical and mental maladies and to concentrate
our mind. In Vedanta, the analysis of different stages of human consciousness is found these
are Jagrata, Svapna, susupti and Turiya. Now, I will be describing what Vedanta said about
the four stages of human consciousness.
The first one he said that Jagrata; that means, when you are waking up, when you are alert
you should know that that you are alert and you are doing this consciously.
Then when you are in say Swapna; that means, when you slept, that is a stage of let us say,
soft conscious stage it is not an un-conscious stage rather it is a soft conscious stage; that
means, you know that you are dreaming something. How it is a soft conscious stage? This is
a soft conscious stage because after your dream when you wake up, when you alert, when
you conscious you can able to recapitulate some of your dreams. Though if not very clearly in
an analytical form or a sequential form but, still some sort of dream you can recapitulate. At
this is happens once somebody will be in soft conscious state. And as I said you are in
consciousness when you are alert. So, this is a two steps, the third step will be Susupti; that

means, when you will have a sleep, dreamless sleep; that means, you sleep and wakeup and
you said that, Oh my god! What I had a sleep in the last night, I did not know anything; that
means, you are dog-tired and you slept. That is also called unconsciousness, it is a stage for
unconsciousness.
The last one is called Turiya where it is a transcendental consciousness, there you feel
yourself ahead of this earth. You feel yourself your existence will be ahead; that means, you
are finding yourself in the air because you detached from all sufferings, pains, attachment and
everything. You are reunion with the God or the spirit.
Therefore, this is a higher level of consciousness. This consciousness is known as Turiya. So,
all these things clearly discussed in Vedanta philosophy. Here is saying that psychological
basis means first you need to control our mind because it is the mind operates everywhere. If
your mind is able to understand or able to grasp something correctly, hopefully you can do
many things in a better way but, in the other hand if your mind will be a very fluctuating one
and diverted one, you could not able to do even a particular thing even if it an easy thing in a
successful way. So, therefore, Vedanta, even yoga philosophy, in Buddhism all these systems
somehow in their own way try to prescribe some of these ideas, some of these suggestions for
all human beings, for all social life to get concentrate on particular task and how to do that
and as a result you could able to do, you could able to success all the works that we attach to
it within our day to day activities.

Now, coming to the next slides. Synthesis of religion and philosophy. I am just reading for
yourself first then I will be analyzing it. The common goal of philosophy and religion are
supposed to be the transformation of human life, emancipation from worldly miseries.
The second point is the concept of dharma is a debatable topic of both philosophy and
religion. What it saying that when you talk about religion and philosophy you find this
prevails across the system whether, it is orthodox or heterodox system.
What they says that the transformation of life, how you can have a happy life, how you can
have a very pleasure life, how can you have life without suffering, how can we have an
intellectual life, all these we will have a discuss on when you will find all the systems. All
they are trying their best to draw some of the conclusion how to get happiness in life.
The second point as I said that emancipation from worldly pleasures or worldly miseries. You
know, in world there are many causes as a result we suffer; however, the suffering can be
eradicated because of some other practices and if you do the practices will be in a better way
that, yes, now all the suffering removed from me or removed from us and we are now a
happy life. So, all these discussion you find when you find the discussion on philosophy and
religion and how they are entertain with each other. Can philosophy will be described without
religion? Can religion to be explained without philosophy? This is the common theme of
some of the Indian philosophical systems.
Now, coming to the last slide. That intellectualism, last point of this slide, that intellectualism,
you find if you read that or a since we will be involving in this course, if it is see my other
slides also in the next to next classes, you find that there is an intellectualism, regress
intellectualism in Indian philosophical system.
Because, though there are many systems, though there are many people involved still there is
some commonality. So, far we have discussed. Now I am saying it is because of the
intellectualism, because of their intellectual regresses, one systems somehow does not agree
with other systems theory. And for that they are giving a strongly, a very very logical and
relational grounds for that. And many cases when they are rejecting to others theory, also
getting defended by that systems. I am giving an example, suppose nyaya said something but,
the existence of the whole world because of the atoms nothing else Whereas, Vedanta said
that it is not the case. It is because of the god, the whole world exist and they put their own

argument; however, nyaya philosophy stick to their own point and strongly say that, no way
do not accept or do not subscribe Vedanta year point because of so and so reason.
So, in this case you find that there is an intellectualism; that means, a theory develope then it
criticize and further develop and further develop. So, intellectual regresses also find in some
of the systems and hence for, they find that all the people who contribute in this all the
systems are all intellectual.

Now, coming to the next slides. Synthetic approach, I will read Indian philosophical systems
while addressing to the individual’s development, also deal with social issues of everyone’s
concern and their impacts on earthly life.
While recommending an individual for spiritual practices, they also suggest some good
practices for social reforms. The third point thus, their concern is not only for individual’s
spiritual attainment, worldly achievement and salvation but, also spiritual transformation of
society.
Indian system, as a total both heterodox system and orthodox system, what they tries to
saying that, we’re not trying to address to a particular individual. Of course, when we’re
trying to a particular individual since individual belong to a society, it is about the society;
however, they strongly claim that whenever prescribing some of the good practices for the
individual one, we are also suggesting that some of the good practice for the societal reforms,

societal changes and societal environmental condition, how to protect the environment, what
are the practice you should do, how the society really helps us somebody’s growth, progress,
understanding, even many of the issues involved in a society. It is a different of religion,
culture all things will be there in a society. So, therefore, all the system tries develop some of
the argument on the societal reforms.
How to really trace the issue in society? How to really say something about the society? As a
result society get developed and since human beings residing in the society also can be
benefited from that. And hence, they can have an intellectual regress for understanding many
more issues and as a result the ignorance from their side will be removed.

Now, this dynamism and faith in the past. There are two points that now I am going to
discuss. What is the dynamism? Every system have their own dynamism because they
understand, the systems who develope, it is not one person developed the system though,
there is a founder of certainly some other systems. The samkhya have one founder but, that
founder has not developed whole the samkhya system. There are many people involved in
that samkhya system. What they are saying that there are many people have their dynamic
thought. It is because of their dynamicness, that whole systems gets celebrated even in the
twenty first century, even in this modern world where technology plays a prominent role till
also we believe many of the concept, many of the ideas already spoken in a long back by the
systems.

If we see Gita, Upanishad, Vedanta all these things, many of the examples also today; the
scientist, the engineer, the doctors that give from that Gita and Upanishad. If that is not
relevant so why should they are giving the examples.
They think that this is the correct example or this is a best example in this context therefore,
always they try to quote some of this argument, some of these lines from Gita, Upanishad and
some of the old scriptures.
So, therefore, it is just because of the dynamic in their own nature, henceforth we are
celebrating even in the technological and modern world. So, therefore, this cannot be ignored
and over looked. I find there are many doctor is a physicians, whose suppose not to believe
on spirit but they say that it is everything depends on almighty.
When they said that we are the human being, we have a limited knowledge, we are doing our
own best but, we cannot assure about the person. It is because of the almighty everything will
be happened on or he might be cure soon. So, therefore, we find that whatever the profession
may be, whatever our growth may be and the growing approach may be, the climate where
we grow, all things depend on the society and because of this dynamism of understanding
society, all the systems exist and they are having the different approach to the understanding
society.
Now, faith in past, we always believe in the past because without past, present cannot be
constructed. The present action that we do it is just because of the past. If in the past if you do
some mistake you can identify. If you are intellectual enough to identify you never repeat it.
So, therefore, past always plays a very vital role.
We read history because to know our past. If we know our past clearly, hopefully in this
present we never repeat something which is not supposed to do in a unethical way. And also
in the future, what we supposed to do now, we are doing it. Because, the past say that if you
do this then the result will be that. So, here I would like to highlight the past is also an
important one.

(Refer Slide Time: 41:24)

Now, coming to the next slide. The faith in karma. All the systems that, orthodox system, they
said that they believed in karma. They said that if we are now having good life in this century
or in this my life or this birth it is just because of my past karma.
And at all if you want to, if I want to try to have a good life in the next birth then I must do
some good karmas in this life. And hence, here I would like to say that it is a theory of
inflows. If you do good karma you will have a good result. If you do bad karma you will have
a bad foot in that way. As you sow, so you reap; it is a famous definition given by each and
everywhere. So, therefore, we say that if you do bad karma all the sanskaras will be
accumulated. Suppose if you do bad karma in this life, all the bad karma if you do and this
will be accumulated and when you will go for the, if you re-born in the next life, all these
things will be repeat further and hence your life will be suffering. I will read it out for you.
He says that the past karma are accumulated in the form of impression in sanskrit it is called
sanskara and it directly falls in our next birth.
Liberation is nothing but, emancipation from the bondage of karma. The last point, different
schools have a different prescription for the attainment of liberation. Though, all people say
about liberation but, they were different opinion about the liberation.

(Refer Slide Time: 42:45)

The last will be faith in rebirth. When you think about karma, when you state about karma,
rebirth has to be come there because theory of karma and rebirth will move hand in hand.
Whatever you do karma, now, what is your karma? Karma is not prescribed anywhere that
you as a human being, as a this adult or a student or a teacher you suppose to do.
Karma has to be decided by you. It is a very contextual or in context specific. If you can
understand your karma, if you do the karma in a good manner hopefully, you will have a
good life. If you cannot do, if you cannot understand what your karma you cannot do better.
Therefore, everyone should follow his or her own karma, if somebody can intellectual
enough, somebody is open mind to understand and also tries to see things in a different way,
in a intellectual way hopefully, he can identify what is not to be done and what is supposed to
be done.
Therefore, if you do good karma, your life will be very pleasurable one in the next birth. I
will read for you. The theory of karmic and rebirth go hand in hand. Your next birth depends
on your present karma. In the same way also, I said that the present life also is depends on
your past karma.
Due to different karma, human soul has to be reborn in different bodies. Liberation frees a
person from rebirth. Except Charvakas, charvakas since, I like to remind the charvaka is
coming under heterodox. The Charvaka system completely says that, we do not believe on

rebirth because, once we will get a birth in this life means we should enjoy and get all the
pleasure whatever best we can get it. This is the heterodox approach of living in this earth.
So, liberation you were is saying is that, that if you good karma there are every chances that
you get liberate. May be there are some practice you have to do as, Vedanta and yoga
prescribes. If you can do well and hopefully you will get the liberation in this life and hence
for your next life, you will see your next life not to suffer. Anyway, that is what they said, that
liberation frees a person from the rebirth. If you do not do any karma; bad karma or good
karma. Suppose if you do all this karma over here and try to be get hope over here, because
of your transcendental conciseness or due to some practice of yoga. That means in the next
time you do not get any birth. Your soul is emancipated. As a human being you are get
liberated. You are being higher than the other people because you understand intellectually it
is much higher.
So, this is all about the discussion today, the introduction to Indian philosophy. This is the
brief, what I have said it is all about brief about the introduction of philosophy, that you find
that there are different kinds of systems. One hand people accept Vedas and in other hand
people do not accept Veda. And again also we find there are many systems or schools; when I
say that Indian systems please also understand as an Indian schools. If I say that in Indian
philosophical system we have six schools; that means, it is in your hand, in heterodox you
have a Charvaka, Jainism, Buddhism in orthodox you have nyaya, Vaisesika, Yogasamkhya
and Mimanasa, Vedanta. So, there are the six systems we find in Indian philosophy.
So, now I believe all these things, now you have understood, what are the commonality you
find, what are the commonality also we do not find among all the systems. And make sure
that, when you say that, suppose a particular point, what are the systems they are prescribing
that and what are the system they are not really prescribing for that and; however, they are
not criticizing to that point. They are saying that we respect to that point.
For example spiritual orientation. For example, believes on god. So, many people do not
accept believe in god; however, they know that there is an existence of god. So, this is for
today’s session and next we will be discussing the Upanishad and the Gita in the very brief
manner. Then we will be discussing one system up to another system. We start with from
heterodox system as a Charvaka.
Thank you.
