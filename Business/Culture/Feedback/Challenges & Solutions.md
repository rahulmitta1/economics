### Challenges in implementing a culture of Candor around the world
Less Direct Cultures
- like Japan.
- They use downgraders in their language to softens the feedback.
- Direct negative feedback is less comfortable and less common.

### Solutions
- With Less Direct Cultures, Increase Formal Feedback Moments.
    - Put feedback on the agenda in as many meetings as possible to take the stigma out of it.
    - First few times you provide feedback, gently mention small things that are easily actionable.
    - Invest time in relationship-building.
    - Provide preparation instructions 
    - Give a clear structure to follow.
    - Live 360 will work well in Japan, if clear expectations are set:
        - Tell them
            - "Please prepare for this and these are the instructions we are going to follow"
            - It is part of their job.
            - What to do and how to do it.
    - "Practice feedback early and often"
    - Create copious formal feedback moments.
