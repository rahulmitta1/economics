#### Don’t work for ‘hours’, work for effectiveness. [JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER]

- "HE WHO WORKS ALL DAY HAS NO TIME TO MAKE MONEY". ~ JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER

Value work breaks as much as work time.
- Work breaks, getting outside, taking your time, 
    - improves your ability to get quality work done. 
    - decreases your burn out rate.
    - increase focus in whatever you're working on.

> Believe in the efficiency. Effectiveness is king. 

The key is not to rush.
- Don’t rush to the office, rush to open up your computer, rush to get stuff done, creating a long list of ‘to do’s’ that never really get accomplished.
- Take your time. Slow things down. Enjoy the process. Have a list of things that need to get done that aren’t work, things that are ideally outside, that get your blood flowing and fresh air into your lungs.
